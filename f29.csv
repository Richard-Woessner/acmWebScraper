An Innovation Activity Framework for Digital Innovation,Lukas Hellwig,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393857,"The digital transformation poses great challenges for companies on numerous levels. It changes existing processes and the activities associated with them. In this paper, we analyse which activities take place within innovation processes in enterprises, taking into account new approaches such as open, user and digital innovation in the context of digital transformation. In our study, we use a comprehensive literature review to identify all relevant activities along innovation processes. In total, 48 activities within seven phases can be identified on the basis of 16 considered references. We further identify eight specific practices of digital innovation and derive a dependency. Hereby, we contribute to a better understanding of the impact of digital transformation on innovation processes and provide a practice-oriented overview. Furthermore, the findings form a solid basis for further empirical studies."
Leveraging Information Systems Outsourcing for Innovation,Marfri Gambal,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393840,"This study is motivated by the apparent shortage of research on information systems (IS) outsourcing engagements that are leveraged for innovation on the client firm's behalf. Building on existing insights related to this managerial problem, we explore factors located within and outside the boundaries of an outsourcing engagement that shape the dynamics of the underlying innovation initiative. We are in the process of conducting a qualitative case study investigating four innovation through IS outsourcing engagements at an Austrian care home. Our preliminary findings indicate that an effective organization of IS outsourcing for innovation necessitates consideration of how engagement-specific factors and factors outside of the project may affect an initiative's innovation potential. With the framework of innovation through outsourcing, we propose an approach to capture these factors holistically."
How does the User Type Affect the Acceptance of Digital Innovation on the Job: Research in Progress,Timon Sengewald,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393845,"Digital technologies promise greater effectiveness and higher productivity for companies. The question of the factors influencing the success of such technologies has long been a subject of research. However, these factors seem to be depending on the user type.

A total of two field observations and 22 interviews were conducted to create a framework that promotes the development of digital innovations by systematically identifying characteristics that improve the adoption rate."
Examining the Influence of Product Innovation on Social Media Platforms: Evidence from Instagram,Reza Alibakhshi,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393836,"Grounding our discussion in social penetration and resource allocation theories, we propose and test the influence of introducing a new product, namely Instagram Story, on the usage and content creation behavior on the Instagram platform. Employing a quasi-experimental setting, we investigate the influence of introducing this new product on user engagement and content generation. Our findings identify the significant influence of Instagram Story on the user engagement with the original product i.e. Instagram Post and the overall resource expenditure by content providers. Through our study we delineate several important implications for both research and practice. Specifically, our study provides significant insights for platform owners and content providers to better design and implement new products on social media platforms."
"Is Cryptocurrency Money?: Three Empirical Studies Analyzing Medium of Exchange, Store of Value and Unit of Account",Jens Mattke,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393859,"Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Ripple, are discussed as a new form of money. Typically, money fulfills three core functions: 1) medium of exchange, 2) store of value, and 3) unit of account. To examine whether individuals consider cryptocurrencies as money, we conduct three studies. Study 1 (N=57) provides valid and reliable measurement items for the three core functions of money. Study 2 (N=95) shows that the general perception about the fulfillment of the core functions is rather positive for cryptocurrencies. The results from Study 3 (N=99) furthermore reveal that Bitcoin is perceived significantly better in fulfilling all three functions than Ethereum or Ripple. The findings suggest that cryptocurrency research needs to include or at least control for the basic perceptions of core functions when examining individuals' adoption or use of cryptocurrency as money. Furthermore, the findings suggest that existing knowledge from Bitcoin use or adoption research cannot be easily transferred to the context of another cryptocurrency."
Policy Formation Without Authority: Towards Resilient Financial Infrastructure for Emerging Economies,Omri Ross,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393849,"We document the design and development of a modular blockchain IT artefact, affording stakeholders in emerging economies the ability to deploy and collectively govern resilient financial infrastructure.

Stakeholders submit and elect 'schemes' implementing policy measures, such as taxation, through voting sessions weighted by 'reputation scoring'. We aim to contribute towards the emerging discourse on the utility of blockchain technology in emerging economies."
Applying Enterprise Architecture for Digital Transformation of Electro Mobility towards Sustainable Transportation,Bokolo Anthony Jnr.,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393858,"Electro Mobility (eMobility) involves deploying Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and electric technologies in vehicles to enable electric propulsion of vehicles referred to as Electric Vehicles (EVs). EVs are key infrastructure for achieving a sustainable energy future since EV usage can support in achieving CO2 reduction. However, the deployment of EVs for eMobility is highly dependent on data integration of mobility solutions from different stakeholders involved in urban transportation. Respectively, data integration from different mobility services will result to cost reduction and create valued added services to citizens. Therefore, there is need to achieve data integration not only for physical systems but for all domains in providing mobility related services that can be synergically applied to citizens and stakeholders in order to develop innovative solutions at district and urban level. Therefore, this study adopts Enterprise Architecture (EA) for digital transformations of eMobility services for sustainable transportation. Action research methodology was employed and secondary data from the literature was presented in the industrial data space reference architecture to initially validate digital transformation of electro mobility. Findings from this study reveal that EA support digital transformation of eMobility in managing data integration to support cities to implement sustainable transportation services."
Automation Anxiety as a Barrier to Workplace Automation: An Empirical Analysis of the Example of Recruiting Chatbots in Germany,Judith EiÃer,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393866,"Workplace automation substantially changes the overall working environment. Through artificial intelligence and robotics, more and more complex tasks can be automated. Various jobs could undergo significant changes or even cease to exist due to these technological advancements. One area affected by these developments is the recruitment in enterprises. Chatbot systems have the potential to automate the communication processes within recruiting. This automation could cause automation anxiety perceived by recruiters due to their job being at risk of automation. Within this study, the influence of automation anxiety perceived by recruiters on the acceptance of chatbot technology is assessed. Methodologically, an adaptation of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is proposed for the assessment of recruiting chatbot acceptance by exchanging the original construct computer anxiety with the more focused construct automation anxiety (AANX). The completed pre-study as preparatory work for a more comprehensive recruiting acceptance study presented in this paper resulted in 83 participants. As a preliminary result, AANX is supported as a construct significantly influencing recruiters' perceived level of chatbot acceptance through its positive relationships with job relevance and perceived usefulness. However, recruiters seem to ostensibly focus on the opportunities that chatbot systems offer, which are perceived as useful and positive and only sporadically on potential concerns of this technology."
IoT Devices in the Workplace: Assessing Emerging Challenges for the Enterprises - A Systematic Meta-Analysis,Asif Shaikh,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393863,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is reshaping industries and so is the employees' range of informal-IT usage in the workplace. This research study assesses the emerging risks and threats that arise from the increasing prevalence of employee-owned IoT devices in the new wave of IT-consumerism within enterprise premises. Most enterprises have adapted to the change brought by the personal-IT devices such as laptops, smartphones, and cloud applications, and have introduced security policies of either allowing under Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) environment, or completely restricting its usage in preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information assets. Existing research has started focusing on possible threats of employee use of IoT devices that are outside the control of IT management. This study presents a theoretical explanation of three key aspects that are discussed in the existing scholarship: threat dimension, detection, and prevention of IoT enabled Insider threat."
Digital Assistants Conveying Emotion,Reed Marques,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393842,"Artificial intelligence is evolving at an unprecedented pace. The ability to convey emotion is one of the largest roadblocks preventing artificially intelligent agent from becoming truly anthropomorphic and integral in modern society. There are several works that have made a connection between anthropomorphism and emotion but none have directly tested the effect of anthropomorphism on a user's perceived emotion of the technology. Prior research showed that users prefer to interact with agents who can convey emotion as they perceive them to be more intelligent and humanlike. By being able to systematically increase perceived emotion in intelligent agents, we can further advance the domain of smart devices and increase adoption rates. Higher adoption rates leads to more research and open source projects, which ultimately translates to a better experience using them. This proposed research aims to explore the relationship between users' perceived anthropomorphism and perceived emotion of digital assistants."
The Effect of First Impressions of an E-Commerce Chatbot's Personality and Abilities on Expectations for the User Experience,Sasha Volodin,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393848,"Research shows that a user is less likely to use a chatbot again if there is a failure in the interaction. Hence, first impressions with chatbots could help retain more users and loyal customers for the business. A chatbot's personality, like other anthropomorphic qualities, can give users a sense of the chatbot's abilities. Therefore, we hypothesize that a combination of personality cues and clear information about a chatbot's abilities will help to maximize user experience and increase the number of repeat users of the chatbot. A chatbot's first greeting is important because it is what the user sees before deciding whether to continue using the chatbot. It is also the basis for a user's initial assessment of what using the chatbot will be like and can thus affect the size of the expectation gap. This research could help inform and guide the design of e-commerce chatbots."
Artificially Intelligent or Humanly Artificial?: Examining User Engagement in AI Tools,Shalini Chandra,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393839,"Grounding our work in competency and organizational support literature, we investigate the applicability of the Turing test in fostering user engagement with artificially intelligent (AI) machines. While prior information systems literature posits the significant role of 'instrumental value' of technology in fostering user engagement, Turing's thesis inspires us to design AI machines with 'human competencies'. In our ongoing research, we establish the significant role of task and emotional competencies as the desirable attributes in AI for fostering user engagement. However, our results negate the significance of social competencies in AI for fostering user engagement. These findings have noteworthy implications for both research and practice, which we intend to describe in our poster presentation."

This work-in-progress is building towards a model using student academic features and demographic information to predict students at risk for attrition."
Analysing Gender Bias in IT Job Postings: A Pre-Study Based on Samples from the German Job Market,Stephan BÃ¶hm,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393862,"In Germany, as in many other industrial nations, there is currently a shortage of skilled workers in the IT sector, also known as the ""war for talents"". It is becoming increasingly difficult for companies to find suitable personnel using traditional recruiting instruments. Against this background, but also due to legal requirements, it is becoming more and more important that job postings are formulated in such a way that they have the greatest possible impact and no group of suitable applicants feels excluded. This study presents an approach that can be used to measure the gender bias in job postings in particular. A respective tool could provide recruiters with an instrument to identify and prevent unwanted gender bias. In our study, the prototype of such a tool will be developed and initially applied to analyse job postings in the IT sector of the German job market in comparison to samples from the automotive and health care sectors. We present some key statistics of this analysis and an outlook on future work."
What Makes IT Professionals Special?: A Literature Review on Context-Specific Theorizing in IT Workforce Research,Barbara Prommegger,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393861,"Research on the IT workforce has played an important role in IS research for the past 40 years. An essential part of IT workforce research deals with the contextualization of theories. Models and theories are adapted to the IT environment by integrating context-specific factors to explicitly account for relevant IT-specific conditions. Our literature review addresses context-specific theorizing in IT workforce research to understand IT-specific contextual factors. By analyzing papers dealing with IT workforce related topics published in the Senior Scholars' Basket of Journals and in selected additional journals, we examine the process of contextualization in two ways. First, we synthesize predominant IT-specific contextual factors for IT workforce research. Second, we investigate approaches of contextualization in IT workforce literature. We present nine IT-specific contextual factors grouped by three perspectives. Additionally, we introduce two approaches for contextualization in the IT workforce research and give recommendations for context-specific theorizing. Our literature review contributes to a better understanding of the uniqueness of IT professionals by providing information about how context-specific theorizing is being considered in IT workforce research."
Short-term Affair or Long-term Commitment?: An Investigation of Employees without IT Background in IT Jobs,Barbara Prommegger,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393860,"The IT profession is constantly changing. The rapid development of technology and the high demand for IT specialists has led to a broader and more diverse profile of IT professionals with fewer boundaries regarding organizations and occupations. As a result, companies have encouraged the migration of employees with different backgrounds into the IT sector. Drawing on the theory of the boundaryless profession, we explore this transformation in IT careers. By studying 355 career sequences of IT professionals in Germany, we investigate the career mobility of employees without an IT background working in IT jobs. Our results show that only around one-third of employees without an IT background remained in IT for the long-term. The majority of the sample, however, either returned to their original sector or moved to another after a few years in IT. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the boundaryless IT profession and sheds light on the role of employees without an IT background in IT jobs."

Turnover and Turnaway of IT Workers: A Person-Environment Fit Perspective,Caroline Ernestine Oehlhorn,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393838,"Especially in view of the increasing skill shortage, the retention of information technology (IT) workers in organizations remains one of the three most important IT management issues for practitioners [11]. Organizations are confronted with two relevant behavioral outcomes on behalf of IT workers in this context: turnover and turnaway. While turnover means that IT workers leave their employer and start working for another employer while staying in the IT profession, turnaway reflects the abandonment of the IT profession [9]. Previous research emerging from the CPR community examines a variety of factors that lead to IT workers' turnover and turnaway, e.g. perceived job alternatives [10, 12], job satisfaction, organizational commitment [13], or personality attributes [5]. These can be classified into three categories on a superior level: individual, job-related, and organization-related factors [10]. Do these factors no longer fit with the IT workers' expectations, the intention to turn over or turn away is developed. The influence of the existing or absent fit on workers' individual outcomes, such as turnover or turnaway, is grounded in person-environment fit theory [6, 8]. In the work-related context, this environment fit consists of five dimensions:"
Job Satisfaction Following Turnover and the Moderating Role of Past Job Satisfaction for IT Professionals,Faheem Ahmed Shaikh,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393846,"We investigate job satisfaction of Information Technology professionals after actual turnover using a longitudinal dataset of eight annual waves of data.

Job-Leisure and Work-Family Conflict: Do they Really Matter in IT Professional Turnover?,Kurt A. Hoffmaster,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393867,"Motivation, job satisfaction, and employee turnover intentions are not new topics in the employment of Information Technology (IT) professionals. Several previous turnover intention studies highlighted already proven factors related to turnover intention such as motivation and job satisfaction. There is limited research on the role that job-leisure and work-family conflict play in relation to turnover intention. This study examines how turnover intention in IT professionals is affected by extrinsic and intrinsic motivation when specifically factoring for work-family conflict and job-leisure conflict. Data for this study was gathered from IT professionals across the United States with a total of 170 valid responses. Results of the analysis indicated a significant association with intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction. Our study did not support the hypothesis that extrinsic motivation positively affected job satisfaction. Most importantly, the moderating effects of work-family and job-leisure conflict between job satisfaction and turnover intention were supported. Findings from this study increase the understanding of motivational factors that affect IT professional's turnover intentions."
Communication Measures to Reduce Techno-Invasion and Techno-Overload: A Qualitative Study Uncovering Positive and Adverse Effects,Katharina PflÃ¼gner,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393855,"The perception of specific techno-stressors, such as techno- invasion or techno-overload, negatively influences employees' performance and organizations' profit. Therefore, it is imperative for organizations to implement specific, deliberate mitigation strategies. Among others, communication measures have the potential to reduce employees' perception of techno-invasion and techno-overload. Basing on 38 semi-structured interviews with working employees, this study identifies five communication measures and their positive and adverse effects in reducing techno-invasion and techno-overload from the perspective of employees. Enlarging related research on technostress mitigation, the results show that none of the analyzed communication measures is limitation-free. Therefore, we conclude that organizations need to introduce more elected and comprehensive communication measures, representing employees' individual needs and characteristics to reduce techno-invasion and techno-overload sustainably. Theoretically, our research enlarges prior findings on technostress and on mitigation of technostress presenting specific mitigation strategies for two specific techno-stressors as well as positive and adverse effects of these mitigation strategies."
Danger vs Fear: An Empirical Study on Wearable Users' Privacy Coping,Krutheeka Baskaran,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393856,"With the arrival of Internet of Things, the magnitude of data shared through various devices has seen a drastic increase. Fitness trackers contribute to a significant part of this phenomenon. Increase in collection of individual's information has led to increase in privacy issues like identity theft and targeted marketing. This study treats information privacy as a distinct dimension and develops a model, drawing from extant privacy concern literature, Extended Parallel Process Model and coping theory to understand an individual's coping behavior when faced with a privacy breach to their user generated health data. The model is empirically tested by conducting a sample survey with 225 fitness tracker users. Our findings show that increased privacy concern increases threat perceptions, which has a major impact on an individual's coping behavior. The major contribution of this study is towards the understanding of the impact of fear over loss of one's health-data privacy and the resulting shift in the attitude towards the technology itself. Theoretically this study extends fear appeals theory to information privacy by incorporating the role of individual's privacy concern. This study implies that manufacturers and policy makers in healthcare domain need to re-examine privacy and data processing policies keeping in mind potential consumer privacy concerns."

In this research-in-progress paper, we shed light on how agile information systems development (ISD) practices can influence this relationship. Using the stressor-detachment model as a theoretical base, we present our research model and propose that agile ISD practices reduce work overload and, in turn, foster ISD project success. We furthermore suggest that psychological detachment moderates this relationship. The agenda for data collection and analysis is described."
"Benefits in Privacy Research: A Literature Review, Status Quo and Future Research Directions",Jakob Wirth,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393854,"Research in the stream of privacy considers benefits as an important and central concept. Benefits are the positive outcomes that individuals will experience when disclosing information. However, we see that only few papers theorize benefits in their research and thereby the operationalization and understanding of benefits is mixed, unstandardized and seems to follow no specific order. Based on that observation, we aim to provide a first step towards a standardized usage of benefits in privacy research studies, by summarizing existing benefits in privacy research and categorizing them. To do so, we base on the theory of perceived value. This theory uses five dimensions (emotional value, social value for myself, social value for others, monetary value as well as utility value), which we use to categorize different benefits. The results confirm our initial observations that indeed different constructs of benefits are used even in the same research context without justification. Implications among others refer to the recommendation to use the same term for the same construct and to consider all five dimensions of benefits in privacy research studies."

Challenges of Applying Predictive Analytics in Transport Logistics,Hendrik Birkel,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393864,"The field of Predictive Analytics (PA) provides the possibility to utilize large amounts of data to improve forecasting, data-driven decision-making, and competitive advantage. Especially the transport logistics sector, which is characterized by high business-related uncertainties, time-sensitivity, and volatility, highly benefits from accurate resource and production planning. While success factors and framework conditions of applying PA are well-investigated on a theoretical SCM level, findings on internal and external challenges of transport logistics organizations remain scarce. Therefore, based on a multiple case approach, this study offers in-depth insights into six real-world cases of freight forwarders, ocean carriers, and air carriers. The results uncover both internal and external challenges. From the internal perspective, the biggest challenges are related to the technical implementation including the acquisition of globally generated, internal and external data and its harmonization. In addition, stakeholder management and target setting impede the development of PA. Regarding external challenges, relational and external conditions hamper the application. Therefore, especially actions of third-party institutions in terms of standardization and security enhancements are required. This study contributes to the existing literature in various ways as the systematic identification addresses real-world issues of PA in the neglected but crucial area of transport logistics, discussing urgent research needs and highlighting potential solutions. Additionally, the results offer valuable guidance for managers when implementing PA in transport logistics."
"If I Cannot See It, It Is Not There - A Graphical Approach to De-escalating Commitment",Leonard Michels,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393865,"Escalation of commitment is a common bias in human decision- making. It has been studied for more than 40 years, however, an effective measure to de-escalate commitment is still missing. In order to find a new method of de-escalating commitment, this paper integrates past research on the effects of information about opportunity costs on escalation of commitment, and on the influence of information systems using graphical presentation formats on human decision making. It investigates whether graphically presenting information about opportunity costs or sunk costs influences an individual's tendency to escalate commitment. An online experiment with 380 participants was conducted, in which four decision scenarios were presented. The participants received information about the decision alternatives either in a table or in dashboards containing one graph and a table. Contrary to the first hypothesis, graphically presenting information about opportunity costs did not lead to decreased escalation behavior. The second hypothesis, which proposed an increasing effect of graphically presenting information about sunk costs, was supported by the data. Information systems using graphical information presentation might, therefore, be a promising approach to alter human decisions in economic contexts."
Predicting Success in Using ERP Systems,Bih-Ru Lea,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393843,"This research explores the influence of personality types on ERP system learning performance. Four personality types were identified using cluster analysis based on the Big Five personality traits, i.e., conscientiousness, neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness. These four personality types were found to be significantly associated with ERP learning performance. Additionally, prior knowledge, learning motivation, demographic factors (such as gender, age, year in school), and social as well as culture influences were found to moderate the relationships between the personality types and ERP learning performance. These findings can provide valuable insights for the organizational success of ERP systems by helping to identify which users can learn to utilize these systems effectively."
A Conceptual Model of Antecedents of Emergent Leadership in Agile Teams,Leonard Przybilla,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393844,"Self-organization is a key proposition of agile software development (ASD). Despite this stark emphasis, there is little understanding how self-organization actually works. Drawing on established findings in general group research, we propose emergent leadership, that is taking on leadership roles without formal authority, to be an enabler of effective self-organization in ASD teams. By contextualizing extant knowledge, we develop a theoretical model of antecedents of emergent leadership in ASD teams and how ASD practices reinforce these relationships. Our model is of value to research by increasing understanding which factors make agile teamwork effective."

Embracing this proposition, this dissertation sets out to explore three social phenomena at different levels of the team. Using an external perspective, I explore group divisions, called faultlines, and subgroups in IT project teams. Adopting an internal and cross-boundary view, I investigate the effects of fluid team membership. Lastly, I study emergent leadership in IT project teams as a means of effective organization."
Mass Communication on Social Media: The Case of Fake News,Maximilian Haug,"June 2020,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3378539.3393852,"?Fake News"" is described as misinformation, fabricated to mislead its readers without providing objective facts. The increasing use and relevance of social media in nowadays society elevates the power of the intentional spreading of false information. The terminology of ?Fake News"" first gained attention of the public in the US election in 2016. Stories about election manipulation were shared among social media and were widely discussed in the web. This phenomenon will not decline with the increase importance of social media platforms nowadays. Maliciously spreading false information does not only find application in the political sphere but can also cause economic damage, which the case of the United Airlines in 2008 shows. The impact of what people believe on social media affected the share price after the spreading false information about United Airlines' bankruptcy. Also, misinformation about pandemic outbreaks can harm society as a whole by inducing panic. These instances show that a better understanding of dynamics of social media needs to be investigated, how users engage with information on social media. In contrast to mass communication models in the past, in which a gatekeeper (e.g. a news outlet) had the sole power of what the reader will see on the newspaper, nowadays users themselves emerged to gatekeepers on their own with the possibility to publish information. This opens up paths for new dynamics which are tied to the social media platforms with their sharing and liking mechanisms. The research is based on Westley and MacLean's Model of Communication with the added possibilities for the entities to interact with each other every time. Based on this model, theories of mass communication such as the ?spiral of silence"" or effects like ?the sleeper effect"" shall be tested and evaluated how these phenomena emerge now in the space of social media. There are several theories which explain behavior based on behavior of peers or groups, such as Herding Theory or Theory of Reasoned Action. Further elaboration is needed on how the spiral of silence is unique and how it is different from other theories. Early findings stressed the importance of the source. However, it is not yet clear how platform specific mechanisms such as liking or sharing can influence the perceived public opinion of users."

Unintended Consequences of Wearable Fitness Devices in Corporate Wellness Programs,Laurie Giddens,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322416,"In an effort to reduce insurance costs and improve the health and well-being of employees, corporations are using wearable fitness trackers in tandem with Corporate Wellness Programs. Research shows that CWP improve employee fitness levels, job satisfaction, and well-being. While prior studies indicate that wearable fitness trackers improve user well-being, the potential negative impacts or unintended consequences of introducing these devices in the workplace needs additional investigation. We conduct a case study at a company using wearable fitness trackers in its wellness program. Our initial findings suggest that introducing wearable fitness trackers to wellness programs has a negative relationship with job satisfaction and employee well-being. These findings have implications for wearable technology research and for practitioners utilizing wearables in the workplace."

We used a qualitative research approach to understand the safety concerns of rideshare drivers. The questions investigated were: What makes rideshare drivers feel unsafe? How do rideshare drivers ensure their safety? What are the factors related to rideshare companies that are perceived by rideshare drivers to have a contribution to their safety? We conducted 20 interviews with rideshare drivers in the U.S. to understand their perception of their safety while driving passengers. The study found that rideshare drivers felt unsafe due to passengers' intoxication, and harassment; drivers felt unsafe for personal reasons as well. Rideshare drivers ensured their safety with different means that are sometimes against the companies' Terms of Service."

Integrating Development and Operations in Cross-Functional Teams - Toward a DevOps Competency Model,Anna Wiedemann,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322400,"The integration of cross-functional teams for new product development is still an elusive aim. Cross-functional information technology (IT) teams are used to provide new initiatives in fast-changing and challenging environments. Moreover, concepts such as Development and Operations (DevOps) appear in practice and bring software development and operations tasks in one team. Organizations are currently searching for necessary, suitable competencies for setting up high collaborative cross-functional teams that manage the tasks of the software delivery lifecycle. Therefore, in this paper, employing a multi-perspective research approach, we conducted a workshop and a multiple-case study. Hence, this paper presents a competency model for enabling a high level of collaboration within a team and explains how these competencies are implemented in IT functions. Additionally, we identified six competencies and two major challenges associated with DevOps team setups."

Our goal is not to rehash these debates, but to reflect on them in terms of information technology (IT) work in particular. The purpose of thinking about the future is not to predict with precision or certainty what will happen. Rather the purpose is to sensitize us toward choosing pathways and taking actions that increase the probability of the futures we would prefer and decrease the probability of future states we would like to avoid. This paper considers a number of trends and reflects upon them from the dual, potentially conflicting perspectives of IT worker and of society. We close with our thoughts on convergence of both trends and impact, and potential implications."

Chatbot Acceptance: A Latent Profile Analysis on Individuals' Trust in Conversational Agents,Lea MÃ¼ller,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322392,"According to industry reports, the lack of trust in non-human interaction prevents widespread Chatbot acceptance. Since the willingness and the ability to trust varies between individuals, this study examines to what extent the trust in Chatbots varies accordingly to different personality profiles. Drawing on the HEXACO dimensions of personality, we apply a latent profile analysis and identify three distinct personality profiles, which significantly vary in their trust in Chatbots. A high level of trust in Chatbots, e.g. Alexa, is mainly affected by the two personality dimensions Extraversion and Agreeableness and only slightly by Honesty-Humility. To prevent commercial underperformance and the shutdown of their Chatbot, providers should make sure that users trust in their Chatbot. This can be accomplished, if the Chatbot treats each user based on his or her membership in one of the three profiles identified in this study."
Blockchain Ethics Research: A Conceptual Model,Yong Tang,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322397,"Blockchain is being widely adopted far beyond finance into numerous domains of society and promises unprecedented potential to disrupt organizations, businesses, industries, and economies. However, blockchain is still in its infancy and its future is highly controversial, arousing phenomenal enthusiasm, high expectations, and even intense criticism. The possible impacts of blockchain and its applications on the society could be fundamental and revolutionary, inevitably bringing unpredicted ethical challenges in the foreseeable future. Identifying the ethical challenges of blockchain is urgent and critically needed to ensure that blockchain is adopted ethically. However, discussions on the ethics of blockchain are largely insufficient, which leaves a void of theoretical understanding so far. In this paper, we provide a systematic discussion on the ethics of blockchain applications and map the main social challenges raised by its technology and applications. The paper starts with a review of the technological concepts and applications of blockchain. Then, it overviews the current research on the ethics of technologies and general research on blockchain to briefly introduce the authors' approach. Afterwards, a conceptual model of blockchain ethics research is developed. This research hopes to serve as an initial roadmap for the study of blockchain ethics, and to raise timely awareness and stimulate further debate on the ethics of blockchain in the IS community."

New and Emerging Technology: Ownership and Adoption,Leigh Ellen Potter,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322407,"While new and emerging technology is popularly represented in media and online, this popularity has not translated to broader adoption and purchase by individuals. This paper explores this situation through the lens of individual ownership of computer devices, entertainment devices, and emerging technology, and individual willingness to adopt new technology. We address four questions: What new technology do people choose to own, how willing are they to adopt new technology, what do people consider are barriers or motivators for their decision to adopt new technology, and what does this mean for people's readiness for a new technology workplace? Using a questionnaire instrument with both open and closed questions, we found that our respondents were most likely to own computer devices, less likely to own entertainment devices, and least likely to own emerging technology devices. They reported willingness to adopt new technology, however stated that this should fit well in their personal or work life and be useful to them in order to facilitate adoption. This suggests that the respondents are ready to adopt new technology within the workplace, however emerging technology needs to be easy to learn and cost-effective if it is to be more broadly adopted."
A Strategic View of IT and Innovativeness,Donald E. Wynn,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322401,"We conduct a much-needed empirical investigation of a widely accepted but under-examined factor regarded as essential for organizational innovativeness. This factor, the organizational view of information technology (IT) as a strategic investment, is expected to result in greater innovativeness than a non-strategic view of IT. We address the surprising lack of empirical validation of this expectation and find empirical support for it. Although a strategic view of IT contributes to greater innovativeness, its explanatory power is limited. Our major finding challenges future researchers to extend theory by incorporating additional factors beyond the strategic view of IT. Our findings also caution managers to be aware that additional factors matter."

Computer science courses and academic pathways are not always offered in secondary schools. Many teachers are not trained in computer science, yet are pushed to incorporate more computing, computational thinking, and computer usage. A qualitative focus group study was implemented to assess the computer science identities of African American teachers and of their respective urban secondary schools serving African American students. Three major codes were identified: district administration of computer and computing implementation, teacher attitudes towards computer science instruction, and teachers' recommendations to improve computer science and computational thinking instruction and outreach for African American secondary school students. Findings can be used to improve computer science and technology rollout programs from county and district administrations, teacher instruction with digital tools, and computer science outreach for African American secondary school students."
Attracting Young IT Professionals: An Empirical Study Using the Theory of Attractive Quality,Caroline E.

The so-called war for IT talent illustrates the hard competition of employers for well-educated IT professionals who develop and advance future technologies. Thus, employers are required to court the young professionals' attention to recruit the best of them. Previous research lists certain attractiveness attributes but leaves their interrelations open. We therefore evaluate established attractiveness attributes referring to the Theory of Attractive Quality. To answer the research question? What attracts young IT professionals to an employer?' we conduct an empirical study surveying 223 young IT professionals and evaluate 24 attractiveness attributes that employers should or even need to provide in order to recruit young IT professionals."
The Social Implications of Wearable Information Technologies: Extending IT Identity Theory,Rui Sundrup,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322420,"Existing theories of information technology (IT) use focus on utilitarian benefits to a user but seldom capture the complex socio-emotional relationships people have with IT. Understanding how, why, and when technology users create particular identification with technology use has been critical as technology has gradually become a part of people's identity. This research examines the complex way people relate to IT by exploring how IT can be incorporated into an individual's identity. We extend a conceptual framework from IT identity (ITID) theory to explore the complex relationships people have with IT in a dynamic, social environment. This study also explores how ITID changes over time. The research questions are: What are the social implications of ITID? How do these social implications influence ITID change over time?"
Resolving the Skills Paradox: A Content Analysis of a Jobs Database,Fred Niederman,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322395,"Today, the demand for IS professionals is greater than the supply, and filling the IT pipeline with individuals with the right skills and knowledge is more important than ever. Gaining a better understanding of the technical skills and ""soft skills"" needed in IS jobs will enable industry professionals to focus their recruiting and development practices on these high-priority competencies. In addition academic professionals can better prepare graduates with the right skills and knowledge. The overall objective of this study of IS job descriptions was to determine the job skills in existing IS jobs. This is the first study which is based upon an analysis of actual job descriptions within a large IS operation. The study addressed three research questions, including the skills identified in the job descriptions, the skills weighted by the number of IS professionals in each job, and the skills relevant to job clusters consisting of comparable tasks. Our findings explain the paradox of survey studies showing a predominant need for interpersonal and communications skills while the job advertisements emphasize technical skills. Our analysis indicates that IS job skill and knowledge components include a cross-section of technical skills and ""soft skills,"" and that both skill sets are important criteria in hiring, training, and career development."

Motivating Cybersecurity Advocates: Implications for Recruitment and Retention,Julie M. Haney,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322388,"Given modern society's dependence on technological infrastructure vulnerable to cyber-attacks, the need to expedite cybersecurity adoption is paramount. Cybersecurity advocates are a subset of security professionals who promote, educate about, and motivate adoption of security best practices and technologies as a major component of their jobs. Successfully recruiting and retaining advocates is of utmost importance. Accomplishing this requires an understanding of advocates' motivations and incentives and how these may differ from other cybersecurity professionals. As the first study of its kind, we interviewed 28 cybersecurity advocates to learn about their work motivations. Findings revealed several drivers for cybersecurity advocacy work, most of which were intrinsic motivators. Motivations included interest in the field, sense of duty, self-efficacy, evidence of impact, comradery, and, to a lesser degree, awards and monetary compensation. We leverage these insights for recommendations on how to frame cybersecurity advocacy as a profession that fuels these motivations and how to maintain this across advocates' careers."
Effects of Information Security Legitimacy on Data Breach Consequences: Moderating Effect of Impression Management,Faheem Ahmed Shaikh,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322421,"With legitimacy as a theoretical basis, we argue that firms with higher information security legitimacy draw less firm-specific risk at the stock market. Firms gain information security legitimacy by ensuring that their security practices conform to stakeholder expectations and by actively advertising these efforts. Impression management, by means of voluntary disclosure in case of a data breach, helps firms mitigate financial repercussions on the stock price. We test hypotheses with analyses of stock prices following data breach incidents reported in the media for 150 firms over an eighteen-year period."
Disgruntled yet Deft with IT: Employees who Pose Information Security Risk,Laura C. Amo,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322419,"Malicious insiders are employees who intentionally harm organizational information systems and technology. It has been shown that these types of insiders tend to be disgruntled with work, often times as a result of termination. We identify an additional source of disgruntlement that is also associated with computer abuse: dissatisfaction with information technology resources and support, or IT dissatisfaction. Using a sample of 271 working adults, we demonstrate that employees with higher IT dissatisfaction are more likely to engage in computer abuse. Moreover, the relationship is significantly stronger among employees who consider themselves as technologically competent. Our findings are robust across models with and without control variables, and when using a residual measure of IT dissatisfaction derived from negative affect. We conclude that IT dissatisfaction is a promising construct for researchers and companies to explore further in relation to information security outcomes."

We thus introduce a novel concept of information-securing security-oriented actions-interactions in organizations to interpret the fit/misfit dilemma. Also, we suggest that conflicts can constantly exist between organizational security and business goals. To that end, from a dialectic perspective we elucidate how and why organizations act toward one direction first (e.g. business-oriented), then another (e.g. security-oriented), and eventually a synthesized one."

First, we will develop an initial list of cybersecurity skills by using a systematic literature review to assess what past research has found. Next, we will validate the importance of these skills through a ratings-based survey of employers. Finally, we will refine and prioritize the validated skills using two preference capturing studies - rank order survey and conjoint analysis. Discussion and implications for future research and academic departments in cybersecurity are provided."

What Makes Us IT People?: Autistic Tendency and Intrinsic Interests in IT,Ronnie Jia,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322408,"What makes us IT people? Why are certain individuals more intrinsically interested in IT than others? The existing IS literature offers few answers about origins of such interest as most research models treat it as an exogenous variable and focus almost exclusively on its consequences in user attitudes and behavior. Building on the autism research literature, this study aims to establish autistic tendency as an antecedent of one's intrinsic interests in IT. Results of this research may have several implications. In addition to examining intrinsic interest in IT as a user trait and contributing to the adoption literature, this work also explores it as potentially a distinguishing characteristic of IT professionals, researchers and students, thus contributing to the perennial discussion of ""Are IS people different?"""
Exploring Game Aesthetics as Antecedents of Game Continuance: An Analysis in the Lens of Self-Determination Theory,Bernie Fabito,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322426,"The Mobile Gaming Industry in the Philippines is expected to earn a total revenue of US$85M for 2019 and would continue to grow for as much as US$135M for 2023. Currently, the Philippines is ranked #26 in the Global Revenue Ranking for mobile games. Given this rapid and sustained growth, this may provide opportunities for local game developers to develop mobile games that can compete with known international game studios. To do this, it is essential that motivations of Filipino game players be identified. Though there are studies that have been made to uncover the motivations of mobile game use, it also revealed different claims. For this paper, it is the role of the study to determine the disparity by discovering the various game aesthetics of the five (5) Philippine top-ranking mobile games and how it is associated to the Self Determination Theory's Psychological Motivations and Game Continuance. Nine (9) Game Aesthetics were used to determine the gameplay experience while the Gaming Motivation Scale (GAMS) was used to assess the players' Psychological Motivations. A total of 210 respondents answered the online survey in one university in the Philippines and other Facebook groups for mobile games. Cronbach Alpha yielded a strong coefficient Î± = 0.872 based on the on over-all responses. Results show that the game aesthetics that are experienced by mobile players vary from one game to another. It also shows that the psychological motivations of SDT have a moderate positive relationship to Game Continuance. This study is the first step in understanding the aesthetics that Filipino gamers experience and their psychological motivations on mobile games. Results revealed that game players prefer mobile games that offer challenge, competition, expression, and fellowship game experience."
Machines as Teammates in Creative Teams: Digital Facilitation of the Dual Pathways to Creativity,Leonard Przybilla,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322402,"Considering recent advances in information systems, we pose the question how well a digital facilitator can support the complex task of creative idea generation in teams--especially compared to a human one. Drawing on the dual pathway to creativity model and extant research in group creativity and information systems, we develop a set of interventions for both human and digital facilitation. We test the hypothesized effects in a 2x2 study design with 24 participants and a human or digital voice assistant as facilitators. We find that objective outcomes of digital facilitation are not significantly different from those of human facilitation. Digital facilitation is, however, significantly worse in subjectively perceived helpfulness. These results add to the scant research on the effects of intelligent systems on team interactions and help inform future research on group effects of intelligent information systems."

However, we know little about why and how modern development methodologies impact individual IT professional outcomes. Drawing on concepts from the agile development literature and job characteristics theory, we hypothesize a relationship between agile development usage and IT professionals' stay intention. We examine job satisfaction as mediating the effect of agile development usage on stay intention. We test our hypotheses using a sample of 18,755 software developers drawn from the 2018 Stack Overflow developer survey.

We discuss the implications our findings have on research and practice."
Emergent Leadership in Agile Teams--an Initial Exploration,Leonard Przybilla,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322423,"The adoption of agile development methods is now widespread. A key aspect of the special type of teamwork promoted in agile methods is the proposition of self-organized teams without a formally assigned leader within the team. Contradicting this proposition, agile development is still in need of the outcomes of leadership such as coordination and facilitation of activities, which in turn drive performance. General group research has found leadership to emerge in an informal manner within leaderless teams. Integrating knowledge on governance in IT teams and general group research, we propose a first step to close the knowledge void on emergent leadership within agile teams and its effects on team outcomes. In this research-in-progress, we develop a conceptual model and deduct hypotheses on the emergence and effects of leadership in agile teams. We expect leadership to emerge informally within agile teams. Based on the propositions of agile development, we do not expect a single leader to emerge but leadership to be attributed to several team members. Given the different roles in agile development, this attribution may moreover differ based on different areas of reference. Drawing on extant knowledge of emergent leadership, we expect positive effects on performance if leadership is shared."
Multiple Team Membership in Software Development Gig Work,Mary Beth Watson Manheim,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322424,"A recent survey suggests that 10.2% of software developers work as independent contractors, freelancers, or are self-employed. Whether they fully or only partly depend on gig work for their income, or work in traditional organizations, most software developers must concurrently work on multiple projects with multiple teams across a variety of software development platforms. This creates a complex and fragmented work environment for developers. We refer to this phenomenon as Multiple Team Membership (MTM). Utilizing a multi-method study, our goal is to develop a deeper understanding of MTM in software development by first developing and then empirically testing a research framework that can contribute to the broader context of research on software development challenges in the gig economy."

Identifying and predicting ecommerce diagnostic criteria gives further insight into consumer behavior. Information Diagnosticity accounts for the utilization of criteria differentiation within the decision formation process [1, 4]. In a cross-sectional study of 218 English-speaking Amazon.com customers, recruited on Amazon's MTurk, who were exposed to five online consumer reviews survey stimuli, this research explored the impact of information diagnosticity on consumer purchase intentions. The findings of this study reveal that constructs representing trust and valence in the new model improve fit in ecommerce applications and offer increased power in predicting factors influencing purchase intention behaviors, while taking into account exiting ecommerce use acceptance. The results from 218 survey participants examine the research model identifying diagnostic aspects in ecommerce influencing purchase intentions."
Does Social Media Help in Attracting Talents?,Faiz Ahamad,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322390,"The study examines the effectiveness of social media in recruitment activities. The job seekers, especially who are fresh out of university, have social media as one of the prime source of information. Be it consumer goods to job search, social media such as facebook have become a crucial component of their lives. Hence information related to employment and employer shared on social media influences job choice decisions. However, social media is quite different from traditional job information source, hence creating a differential impact of information source on information recipient. Furthermore, information content and information tie strength with source play crucial role in influencing job decision, which has been examined in this study."
Establishing a Framework to Measure Strategic Social Value of Online Engagements: A Model for Determining Social Identity,Carlos D. Buskey,"June 2019,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3322385.3322404,"Over the past few decades, social networking connections through individuals, business and organizations have become a useful and rapidly available tool for establishing/maintaining relationships, communicating, and expanding businesses. Users on social media platforms, invest hours in the building of social capital and cultivating their social identity (SID) via online engagements. This paper presents a methodology to quantify the essential artifacts that are derived from online social engagements and design a framework that assists in measuring the value of an individual's online social engagements. Ultimately all users will earn a SID value, which is the score from the time invested on social media platforms. This score will immediately assist users in determining its return on investment (ROI) and social capital earned from online social networking activities. SID will provide an understanding of personal, career, and business opportunities."

Patient Preferences for Authentication and Security: A Comparison Study of Younger and Older Patients,Ann Fruhling,"June 2018,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3209626.3209702,"We examine authentication and security preferences of younger versus older patients in the healthcare domain. Previous research has investigated users' perception of the acceptability of various forms of authentication in non-healthcare domains, but not patients' preferences. First, we developed an interactive prototype to test three authentication methods: passwords, pattern, and voice. Our results indicate that younger patients prefer passwords by a significant margin. Older patients indicated more mixed preferences. In addition, we evaluated the level of security patients desired for protection of health information compared to financial information. We found no difference based on age: both groups felt financial security is more important than health data security. The findings of this research can be used to improve and enhance usability of future PHRs and overall PHR usage by patients. While this study is specific to cardiology patients we believe the results are generalizable to all patients with chronic conditions."
Can IT Improve Cardiac Treatment Quality?: A Quantitative Study of Interaction between Technology and External Factors,Shounak Pal,"June 2018,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3209626.3209704,"The scope of healthcare information systems (HIS) is immense. It can not only help in providing easy access to data and taking decisions, but also ensure following standard procedures and improve quality. Prior literature have discussed on technology impact while controlling for the organizational and economic factors. However, there is a dearth of research on the effect of their interaction with technology. Moreover, overall technology impact misses the depth of application-level impact. Our work discusses the application-level impact and also empirically shows the effect of its interaction with other external factors. Our finding for 2010 show that use of HIS in nursing activities was significant in improving care quality. Disease-specific applications also have a positive effect under the influence of organizational factors. In 2013, per-capita income has significant effect on the impact of technology. Moreover our results show a considerable increase in the significance of technology and the interplay between technology and external factors in 2013 from that in 2010. Thus, our work motivates researchers to explore factors influencing the effect of technology. It directs managers to prioritize their investment on applications based on their impact on healthcare quality."
A Meta-Review of IS Health IT Research and Development of a New Framework,Mike Gallivan,"June 2018,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3209626.3209714,"In the past decade, research on healthcare IT (HIT) has become an established domain in the IS field [33]. Given the large number of HIT papers published in IS journals, as well as the many special issues dedicated to HIT, and the role of IS special interest groups (e.g., AIS SIG Health) and specialized HIT conferences, it is time to take stock of the contributions of the IS community with regard to HIT. This paper provides a meta-review of HIT research - a review of nine prior IS HIT review papers from journals and conferences. Based on insights from our analysis, we create a new framework to classify IS HIT research (the PRECIOUS model). We argue that our framework leverages and extends the well-known PICO framework used in medical research to render it useful for IS scholars who seek to locate or classify the contributions of IS scholars to HIT research. In creating our PRECIOUS model, we also seek to remedy several problems that have previously been noted regarding the limitations of the conventional PICO model."

Based on extant literature in agile software development (ASD) and group research, a model of effects of ASD practices and the constructs elaboration, i.e. direct sharing, of information and team reflexivity, i.e. how much teams reflect on processes and outcomes, is developed and assessed using a survey of agile teams. Previous findings on negative effects of subgroups on conflict and satisfaction are corroborated in an agile setting. Retrospectives enhance team reflexivity and elaboration of information. As expected, elaboration of information significantly attenuates effects on conflict. Surprisingly, reflexivity is seen to further exacerbate the negative effects of perceived subgroups on conflict and satisfaction."

If You Can't Say Something Nice: Factors Contributing to Team Member Silence in Distributed Software Project Teams,Stacie Petter,"June 2018,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3209626.3209718,"Managing software projects is complex. Increasingly, organizations are using different methods and forms of teams to ensure software projects are developed on time, on budget, and meet functionality requirements. One factor that can affect the success of a software development team is the willingness of team members to be fully engaged and to share concerns throughout the effort. Employee silence is the unwillingness of an individual to express concerns. This exploratory research study examines three factors that influence a team member's choice to remain silent when participating in a distributed software project: the individual's level of experience, the role of the offending team member, and the individual's personal responsibility to report. Using a scenario-based experiment, this study finds that some of the factors that are assumed in other contexts of employee silence may not be related in the context of distributed teams in which there is a need to voice concerns among peers."

Therefore, this research aims to identify distinct profiles of individuals avoiding social media advertising. We build upon the advertising avoidance model and take a person-centered approach, using latent profile analysis to identify different profiles of individuals, who avoid social media advertising. We identified three distinct profiles of individuals, differing in their perception and their level of avoidance: unconcerned users, playful avoiding users and goal-oriented users. We contribute by characterizing individuals avoiding SMA, so that companies can use these profiles to derive different strategies how to deal with different profiles."
Effects of Leaderboards in Games on Consumer Engagement,Laura C.

Gamification, as a means of engaging consumers [6, 10, 16], has become more and more popular and implemented in a range of user-oriented applications. However studies have shown that it may not always have the type of impact as initially projected [12, 13]. Gamification yields different, sometimes contradictory, results with regard to the engagement outcomes. Researchers have argued that gamification is not always properly implemented and may not have consistent positive effects [14], as the reward mechanisms and intensified competition could create a controlling gaming environment that could dampen the intrinsic motivation of the participants [13]. Therefore, it is important for businesses and organizations to be able to gauge the impact of gamified interventions and evaluate return on investment."
The Classification of Aggressive Dialogue in Social Media Platforms,Jaida Langham,"June 2018,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3209626.3209720,"The significance of aggression for the understanding of human behavior cannot be over amplified. It associates the individual, behavior, habits, environment, and health (mental). Understanding specificity when it comes to types of aggression and aggressive behavior can help with implementing appropriate countermeasures to those who demonstrate aggressive behavior within their speech and behavior on social media platforms. Through a research synthesis utilizing different search engines to find work on hate speech detection, hate, anger, aggressive behavior in social media, and the consequences associated with these terms, it can be concluded that previous work on hate speech detection have developed methods that ignore the variety in speech, possible other categories of hate speech, the correlation of speech to human behavior, and demonstrate minimal to no empathy toward the users from which this data was extracted from. Categorizations of hate speech currently only include hate and offensive language. Another category that should be added is anger. Future studies should specify their searches to including aggressive behavior since it is the connection when analyzing human behavior and hate speech."

For that reason, a better understanding of how interview anxiety is affecting underrepresented minorities in computing should be a goal of academic institutions and companies who plan to hire these students. Technical computing interviews often require more than just knowing how to code, and students are not always aware of this. The current study investigates interview anxiety, interview performance among African-American students at Historically Black Institutions and the tools they use to prepare for interviews. Findings suggest that interview performance decreases as interview anxiety increases, supporting past research. Also, results suggest that experience going through interviews have a positive impact on interview anxiety. The major contributions of this work include: further understanding of the research literature for interview anxiety in relation to African American students in computing; incite in how this group of students prepare for interviews."

In this research, by providing a technological component to the existing Job Demand-Resource framework, we investigate the relationship between individual technostress creators and burnout in an Indian context. We also examine the interaction among technostress creators to identify the mediating impact of techno-invasion and techno-insecurity. Analyzing a total of 163 responses, collected through an online survey we found encouraging pieces of evidence for our hypotheses. Specifically, our findings revealed that among the five technostress creators, only techno-invasion and techno-insecurity are positively related to burnout in an employee. The contributions of the study to theory and practice are also discussed."
The Flip Side of the Coin: Employer Social Networking to Find Job Seekers,Bruce C.

Business competes for personnel in a dynamic employment market; securing the best prospective employee requires dedicated use of parallel networking channels to identify applicants of interest. One channel is interpersonal and is highly favored, carrying the power of interpersonal trust in the form of recommendations from ""known others."" Applicants and employers, alike, favor strong personal connections when it comes to evaluating opportunities and prospects. The other channel is intermediated, and characterizes the confused conventional knowledge notion that online social media are effective channels through which applicants can influence employers. The true state of this channel's effect lies more in the employer's ability to use online social media as a filtering and qualifying mechanism to vet employees in advance of considering whether to engage in further interactions toward employment."

Thus, a thorough examination of users' experiences with these agents is indispensable. After all, it is merely the interaction between the human actor and the system that enables the artifact to be of consequence. This study uses an affordances lens to explore such use patterns. We qualitatively analyze 232 interviews with personal intelligent agents' users. The results reveal sensory affordances that support functional ones (hands-free and eyes-free use, familiarity and emotional connection) and dominate the users' experience with these agents. We also detect cognitive (personalization and learning from interactions), functional (speedy assistance and usefulness), and physical affordances (potential improvement). These findings have implications for researchers and practitioners alike seeking to understand usability patterns and challenges resulting from the integration of Apple's Siri, Google Now, Amazon's Echo and Microsoft's Cortana into users' everyday life."

Grounded in the social presence and the social network theories, we hypothesize the differential impacts of an online health community member's brokerage and influence in the web-of-support on a) extent of social support, and two self-absorption linguistic features namely b) self-focused and c) socially-focused words in social support text. Variables were operationalized using text mining and social network analyses. We empirically tested our model using panel-data collected from an online health community for diabetics. Higher brokerage results in more support from the member; however, the marginal effect is decreasing. Higher influence results in reduced support; however, the effect is increasing at higher levels. Higher brokerage and influence results in more socially-focused support; however, the marginal effect is decreasing. Higher brokerage and influence results in less self-focused support; however, the marginal effect is increasing."

A Predictive Method to Determine Incomplete Electronic Medical Records,Amir Talaei-Khoei,"June 2018,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3209626.3209706,"This paper is utilizing predictive models to determine missing electronic medical records (EMR) at general practice offices. Prior research has addressed the missing values problem in the EMRs used for secondary analysis. However, health care providers are overlooking the missing records problem that stores the patients' medical visits information in EMRs. Our study provides a technique to predict the number of EMR entries for each practice based on their past data records. If the number of EMR entries is less than predicted, it warns the occurrence of missing records with the 95% confidence interval. The study uses seven years of EMRs from 14 general practice offices to train the predictive model. The model predicts EMR data entries and accordingly identified missing EMRs for the following year. We compared the actual visits illustrated by de-identified billing data to the predictive model. The study found auto-correlation method improves the performance of identifying missing records by detecting the period of prediction. In addition, artificial neural networks and support vector machines perform better than other predictive methods depending on whether the analysis aims at detecting missing EMRs or when identifying complete EMRs with no missing records. Results suggest that clinicians and medical professionals should be mindful of the potential missing records of EMRs prior any secondary analysis."

Building an Honest and Capable Crowd Workforce,Yi Wang,"June 2018,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3209626.3209713,"One of the major challenges of crowdsourcing is to build a labor force that is not only capable but also honest. Prior research on crowdsourcing-mechanism design mostly focuses on motivating individual worker's effort, while neglecting the importance of building highly trustworthy crowd labor force who tends to honestly report the quality of the microwork. To fill this gap, we propose a novel mechanism in this paper. The proposed mechanism combines the principal-agent model and signaling game to enable the information exchange from crowd workers to a requester, and to provide dynamic financial incentives/punishments to honest/dishonest behaviors identified in random quality inspections. To evaluate our proposed mechanism, we perform extensive simulations. Our results suggest that the proposed mechanism is effective and efficient to motivate workers who are capable but less honest to change their behavior when sending signals to indicate their finished microwork, while the extra cost of implementing the proposed mechanism could be minimal. With the behavioral changes of the ""liars"", a highly capable and honest labor force of crowd workers may be developed. The model is also useful as a foundation for theoretical and empirical studies of information exchanges from worker to a requester in the crowdsourcing market."
The Impact of E-Mentoring on Information Technology Professionals,John Cotton,"June 2018,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3209626.3209715,"Our research examines the impact of virtual mentoring, or E-mentoring. We surveyed 133 IT professionals as to their experiences as protÃ©gÃ©s. We asked them about their mentoring relationships, as well as job and career outcomes, and the extent to which they interacted with the mentor virtually. We predicted that E-mentoring would lead to less effective mentoring relationships, less mentoring satisfaction, and lower career outcomes, and that these effects would be moderated by age (millennial protÃ©gÃ©s versus older protÃ©gÃ©s). We found few effects, other than lower satisfaction with E-mentoring relationships. The results suggest that E-mentoring can be as effective as face-to-face mentoring. However, few in our sample had completely virtual mentoring relationships, so it may still be possible that E-mentoring with almost no face-to-face interaction may be less effective."

The Role of Historically Black Colleges and Universities in American STEM Education,Curtis C. Cain,"June 2018,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3209626.3209712,"This paper positions the discussion of leveraging Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the effort to increase diversity in STEM Education. STEM Education can be prominently featured at HBCUs with the outcome of producing STEM graduates that enter into technical fields. As HBCUs shift from their initial founding and look to achieve strategic success in other areas, STEM Education would seem to be a natural fit. However, as with many well-intentioned goals at HBCUs, the ability to be successful in STEM Education hinges on several criteria, including funding, external corporate partnerships and internal collaborations. Given the roadblocks that HBCUs face and have been able to overcome, thus far, anchoring themselves as a cornerstone in STEM Education could prove to be a shift they could master. We conclude with five research questions that should further be explored by HBCUs as an extension of their STEM Education goals. HBCUs are unique institutions that will continue to play a pivotal role in America's postsecondary educational system. Participation in STEM education is just one of the many ways their role will continue to be solidified."

As we demonstrate on the analysis of a seminal framework by Gregor (2006), a given set of categories can be criticized and challenged in light of potentially valid alternatives. In contrast, we suggest for researchers to adopt the assumption of fluidity of categories, which leads to a different approach to demonstrating the contribution of research that deals with categories."

The Evolving Emphasis on Hard and Soft Skills in the IT Profession,Tenace Kwaku Setor,"June 2018,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3209626.3209728,"Technology IPOs expose Information Technology (IT) firms to significant challenges that are fundamentally different from those faced during the founding or startup stage. To tackle the post-IPO challenges, IT firms pay premium wages to hire professional executives from the external labor market rather than from within. Yet, how the executive pay of external hires compares to that of internal hires when IT firms mark significant milestones in their lifecycle remain understudied. The current study therefore examines the pay of internal and external hires and place it within the context of the IPO timeline i.e. pre- and post-IPO. By analyzing data from multiple sources using a linear mixed effects modelling technique, we find that IT firms pay internal hires significantly higher than external hires in the pre-IPO stage. In the post-IPO stage, IT firms pay external hires significantly higher than internal hires. We discuss the implications of the findings on theory and practice."
Features Related to Patient Portal User Satisfaction: N-Gram-Based Analysis of Users' Feedback,Mohammad Al-Ramahi,"June 2018,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3209626.3209729,"""U.S. health care spending grew 5.8 percent in 2015, reaching $3.2 trillion or $9,990 per person. As a share of the nation's Gross Domestic Product, health spending accounted for 17.8 percent"" [1]. Therefore, an intensive national effort to improve healthcare using information technology (IT) with a focus on reducing costs and increasing quality of service is well underway. In this regard, patient portals, known as personal health records, show promise as tools that patients value and that can reduce healthcare cost and improve health. These Health Information Technology (HIT) are positioned as a central component of patient engagement through the potential to change the physician-patient relationship and enable chronic disease self-management. Patient portals can lead to improvements in clinical outcomes, patient behavior, and experiences. However, portal adoption is still low, due to technological limitations and to the lack of adaptability to primary care practice workflow [2]. Large studies in outpatient settings have found that providing patients with adequate functionalities leads to increases in patient satisfaction and then adherence to patient portal [3]. In fact, patient portal user satisfaction is increasingly recognized as an important component of quality [4]. However, little is known about the different patient portal characteristics that are associated with higher patient satisfaction. It seems there is insufficient evidence to support how portals empower patients and improve quality of care. According to the literature, many studies have addressed the relationship between the use of health information technologies and patients' satisfaction [4-7]. Despite the fact that there is some evidence that such technologies improve and enhance patients' satisfaction, there exist some inconsistencies in the findings and reported results [4]. The literature also highlighted the need for further research that focuses on use of the patient portal and measures of quality indicators such as medical outcomes, medication adherence, and patient satisfaction [5]. In this study, we systematically analyze users' reviews of mobile patient portal to extract features that are associated with patient satisfaction. To this end, we use user rating as a proxy for user satisfaction and adopt word-level n-grams to represent user reviews. We use MyChart reviews as Epic has captured significant market share with at least partial health information for 51% of the US population. It has been described as the default EHR choice not for its superior performance, but because other systems are considered inferior [8]. Specifically, in this research, we aim to identify predictors of patient satisfaction based on a systematic analysis of user feedback from actual use of patient portal. The data were collected using a web crawler. We obtain our data set consisting of 500 reviews. For data preprocessing, we removed stop words and represented user reviews using vectors of word-level n-grams weights. For the word n-grams, we include unigram, bigrams, and trigrams. We perform feature selection using the commonly used Chi-square (X2) method. To evaluate the predictive power of the features selected, we chose four evaluation metrics, precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 Score. Results analysis show that the majority of selected features are related to the ease of use of the patient portal, other features are related to specific features and functions the users can use within the application such as scheduling appointments, communication with health providers, using the calendar, etc. Results also report ""touch id"", fingerprint recognition feature, which is a security related feature that allows users to log in to their portal. The performance results of the features selected in predicting user satisfaction using different classifiers such as decision tree, linear SVC, ridge classifier, logistic regression, Bernoulli NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB), and random forest show very good performance with accuracy ranging 73%-80%, F1 ranging 81%-86%, Precision ranging 88%-96%, and Recall ranging 75%-79%."

Are Friendly and Competent the Same?: - The Role of the Doctor-Patient Relationship in Physician Ratings,Maximilian Haug,"June 2018,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3209626.3209734,"More and more people regularly use physician rating websites to inform their choice of physicians. As physician rating websites attract more users, the number of such websites is expanding as well. Research on several German and English physician rating platforms has shown that despite similarities among the factors constituting ratings across platforms, there is no standardized set of such factors. The lack of a framework explaining how physicians are rated makes it difficult to compare how patients perceive and evaluate their doctor, and how physician ratings are calculated. As a step toward developing such a framework, this study identifies the factors influencing how satisfied patients are with their physician, and therefore how they rate them, assuming positive ratings on rating websites correlate with patient satisfaction. Past medical and healthcare-related research indicates that overall patient satisfaction is influenced by factors directly attributable to the physician, such as the quality of the medical treatment and the doctor-patient relationship, as well as by factors attributable to the administrative aspect of medical treatment services, such as waiting times, accessibility and the physical environment of the physician's office. This research focuses solely on the factors directly associated with the physician. The literature identifies two main determinants of patient satisfaction with the physician: the perceived competence of the physician and the interpersonal relationship between the doctor and the patient. The influence of perceived competence of the physician is a controversial construct among practitioners, who argue that in general most patients are laymen in the field of medical treatment and are not able to accurately assess treatment quality. In other words, this knowledge gap between patient and physician skews perceived competence. The second important determinant of patient satisfaction are interpersonal aspects such as how much the patient likes the physician, which influences the patient's perception of the physician's technical skills. This kind of satisfaction focuses on the short-term evaluation of the physician and does not consider medical treatment outcomes, which is often only possible after much more time has passed and, even then, may not necessarily be directly or solely attributed to the treatment. In this study, patients (n=115) in waiting rooms of five physicians in southern Germany were part of the quantitative data collection how satisfied they are with their physician and, therefore, how they would rate them. The data was evaluated using the partial least square method, and convergent validity, construct reliability and discriminant validity were tested. According to our results, the doctor-patient relationship and perceived competence are major determinants of satisfaction. More importantly, our findings indicate a strong influence of the doctor-patient relationship on perceived competence, supported by high cross-loadings of the two constructs. This finding indicates that patients who like their physician are likely to rate the physician's competence highly. This has important implications for the value of ratings as an information source. Patients may perceive ratings as an indicator of quality medical treatment, but the reviews and ratings on physician rating websites are a stronger indication of empathy, sympathy, amiability and likeability. The data also indicates that patients generally view their physicians positively, which is in line with previous research on physician ratings showing that patients ratings of physician rating websites usually favor their physician. This study fails to collect sufficient data about factors influencing patient dissatisfaction, since the sample had a heavy positive bias. In addition, this study does not measure rating behavior directly, but rather assumes strong correlation between high patient satisfaction and positive physician ratings. Further research will focus directly on the rating behavior on physician rating websites and the influence of treatment outcomes. To challenge the positive bias of patients, specialists should be chosen for the study, who are only visited few times by patients."

Our research describes an empirical study of eight years of undergraduate IS placement data. The primary research question presented here is in response to arguments made in the theoretical paper by Neiderman, Ferratt, and Trauth (2016) with a goal to test if IS employment trends are shifting in response to the need for ""bridging"" workers who understand both IS and the business.

Improving Student-Driven Feedback and Engagement in the Classroom: Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Speed Dating Model,Sara Moussawi,"June 2018,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3209626.3209739,"Information Systems (IS) pedagogy research supports the use of collaborative learning strategies that are based on the belief that learning increases when students work together to solve problems and develop cooperative learning skills. The use of innovative active learning approaches instead of lecture-based approaches have helped to engage student learning and build a broader range of skills and experiences (e.g., [1, 2]). In this project, we present an empirical comparison of two active learning classroom approaches - the speed dating method and a traditional presentation format. The speed dating method supports low-cost rapid comparison of project ideas, design, application and progress in a structured and bounded series of serial engagements. In contrast, traditional student presentations allow individuals to provide content but offer somewhat limited interactions. We analyzed data from 174 student surveys and in-class researcher observations of student engagement in an undergraduate senior capstone course entitled, Innovation in Information Systems. The course is centered on studio-based learning as assignments are primarily project-based, students' work is periodically evaluated through critiques, and students continuously engage in critiquing peers' work [3]. The course utilized an alternating series of speed dating and presentation session formats. Our analysis resulted in three main findings. First, students reported receiving and giving much more helpful feedback during the speed dating sessions than in the presentation sessions. Second, students reported being significantly more engaged during the speed dating sessions than in the presentation sessions Finally, classroom observations of engagement showed that students were significantly more engaged in the speed dating session as compared to the presentation session [4]. We believe these findings demonstrate that the speed dating method is a more effective alternative to a presentation format and is a useful complement to other collaborative learning methodologies."

The Individual Narrative of IS Project Success,Saifur Rahman Bhuiyan,"June 2018,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3209626.3209630,"Project success continues to be a concern for information systems practitioners and academics alike. Previous research has studied organizational attributes such as governance, knowledge, and individual attributes mainly focused on project leadership that can affect performance. This study makes an effort to shift the focus to IS professionals who are at the core of IS projects and explores how IS professional's individual narrative of IS project success develops. Using the attribution theoretical lens, the study proposes that the development of the narrative of IS project success is a process of casual attribution involving perception of justice, engagement and perception of project performance. Seventy-nine IS professionals from various organizations participated in a survey which measured the project performance for projects they completed in the recent past, their level engagement in those projects, and their perception of justice during those projects. Respondents represented a wide variety of industries such as retail, telecommunications, and food from both US and non-US project locations. Besides explaining the narrative of IS success, the study also reveals that this narrative has potential downstream effect on the well-being of the IS professional. The study is expected to enrich the IS project management literature by providing deeper understanding of the perception of professionals working in IS projects."

Social Media and Public Discourse: A Technology Affordance Perspective on Use of Social Media Features,Sunil Reddy Kunduru,"June 2018,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3209626.3209627,"In this paper we present the proposal for a research study that aims at explaining the consequences of social media use on mass media content and public discourse. Social media is defined as a set of networked communication platforms that enable generation, distribution and consumption of user generated content. Technology features of the social media platforms are at the center of our analysis. The use of social media features is conceptualized using technology affordance theory. Borrowing from mass communication literature, we argue that media content is produced as a result of a dialectical relationship between media discourse and public opinion. The consequences of social media use on public discourse are conceptualized in terms of the changes in the dialectics between media discourse and public opinion resulting from the use of social media. Two types of public discourses are identified. We develop theory from extant literature to arrive at proposition on consequences of use of specific social media features on the media content and public discourse. Propositions are presented both for the general public discourse case and the context of particular type of discourses. We conclude this proposal by discussing the potential contributions of our study."

Modeling and Evaluating Mobile-based Interventions for Food Intake Behavior Change,Jieun Shin,"June 2018,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3209626.3209634,"Food intake is an important form of health information to observe the current status of personal health, which enables setting healthy eating goals and choosing a better diet. Based on monitoring food intake information, customized mobile interventions can help in advising users to consume a diverse and desirable quantity of healthy foods. However, previous research has not assessed whether mobile interventions enhance healthy eating behavior as an intermediary when determining whether the interventions impact health outcomes. To design mechanisms for behavior change, we need a better understanding of how mobile-based interventions affect users' motivation to change food intake behaviors and lead to healthier behavior. In this proposal, we categorize the prior interventions and behavior change techniques mainly based on three behavioral theories, i.e., control theory, theory of planned behavior, and theory of operant conditioning. Subsequently, the purpose of this thesis is: (1) to model theory-based mobile interventions for managing food intake, and (2) to investigate the impact of these mobile interventions on healthy eating behavior as an intermediary to better health outcomes. To this end, we propose three field experiment designs for future study."

Information technology (IT) increasingly plays an important role in many transformations because of significant digitization of business processes and massive investments in IT since 1960s [1, 2]. However, genuine transformations, even if necessary, often face difficulties because of an incomplete understanding of how to drive and manage transformations. In my talk I will describe some findings and lessons based on my research on transformations [3], and various facets of what I call digital intelligence [4]. I will argue that although information technology is often an important enabler of transformations, sustainable and desirable transformations need much more. They also require attention to leadership; strategic planning; customer, employee and process focus; governance and long-term orientation that balances interests of various stakeholders; and what I call disciplined autonomy. Achieving success often requires an understanding of how to configure these elements optimally in a particular context. I will discuss some of my research on IT human capital, digital skills and its impact at the individual and household levels to suggest implications for policy, managers and IT professionals."

This study achieves its purpose by drawing on distributive justice theory to differentiate two important referents for IT professionals' distributive justice evaluations: organizational or internal referents, and professional or external referents. Data for this study was collected through a survey research design in a large multinational organization headquartered in India. Analysis of the data indicates that IT professionals distinguish internal distributive justice from external distributive justice. Internal distributive justice evaluations were higher than external distributive justice evaluations in this sample. Both internal and external distributive justices are positively related to pay level satisfaction, thereby validating the former construct's multidimensional nature. We conclude the paper by discussing the implications of the findings for research and offer recommendations for the management of IT professionals."
Analyzing Gender Pay Gap in Freelancing Marketplace,Alpana Dubey,"June 2017,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3084381.3084402,"Diversity and inclusion are becoming major focus areas for most of the organizations these days. It has shown to bring several positive impacts to organizations such as highly engaged and motivated employees, improved team dynamics, sustainable team structure, and better work outcome. Pay and career opportunity are some of the indicators to assess diversity and inclusion practice. In this paper, we study gender pay gap in freelancing marketplace. Freelancing marketplaces are open to everyone and gender neutral; hence, it is expected that gender pay gap should not be much over these platforms as freelancers can quote or negotiate the price for the jobs as per their wish. However, our study, performed on 37,599 freelancers, reveals a gap in pay between male and female freelancers. Moreover, the study shows that female freelancers undervalue themselves compared to male freelancers having similar profile. Our study suggests that there is a need to address this large scale pay gap issue by guidance and counseling of female freelancers."

While much has been written about the factors influencing the success of EA programmes, there are few empirical investigations of the role of critical success factors (CSFs) in the success of EA programmes. This study condensed the very broad literature on CSFs for EA identifying six key CSFs that share a broad consensus in the literature. A qualitative case study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the six key CSFs would distinguish between the successful and the unsuccessful programmes. Analysis of the case study data reveals that three key CSFs associated with the use of EA tools did not distinguish between successful and unsuccessful cases while three key CSFs related to the process of EA programme implementation did so. The study concludes that success in EA programmes comes more from how architecture is practiced than what is practiced. The findings have important implications for EA suggesting that the methodological skills of architects need to be supplemented with an understanding of practice."
The Impact of Process and IT Modularity for Mutual Understanding among Business and IT,Christian Jentsch,"June 2017,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3084381.3084412,"Due to an increasing degree of business specialization, business systems nowadays can be very complex. Often, complex systems need to be managed by more than a handful of people from the business unit. To handle the extensive amount of information in a complex business system, the system needs to be supported by an appropriate IT system. However, for the IT unit it can be a challenging task to implement appropriate IT system in complex business environment. In our research, we argue that mutual understanding among business and IT plays a critical role in the successful management of the business system. To achieve a mutual understanding, the complexity needs to be reduced by a modularization of the system. In our empirical study, based on 119 survey results, we found that process modularity only in combination with an IT architecture which matches the modular structure enables a profound mutual understanding. While modular business processes enable mutual understanding of the business strategy, an IT architecture which match the modular process facilitates mutual understanding of the business process."

We adopted Signaling theory from marketing literature to breakdown the cognitive process of buyers when they face a mixture of true and fake advertisements and guarantees from the E-vendor, and how they perceive the signals to be honest and true. We posit that Social Presence signals from reviewers in the feedback system possess the bonding ability that makes the cost/difficulty in sending fake signals prohibitively high in given feedback system. This perceived credibility in feedback system then positively influence the perceived credibility of trust-building signals, as the cost for sending fake signal without being exposed by the feedback system is extremely high. Finally, the perceived level of trust in the E-vendor positively influence the perceived credibility of risk-reducing signals, because the potential loss of sending out fake signals will jeopardise established consumer trust, which is highly sought after and valuable. By identifying the reinforcing effect between these constructs rather than parallel constructs, we hypothesize that interpersonal signals serve as a ""primer"" that can trigger this chain reaction, and feedback system has a much broader implication in the formation of online trust than previously recognized. For practitioners of e-commerce, this study provides an alternative source of trust-building tools apart from costly traditional signaling behaviors."
Understanding Mobile Banking Usage: An Integrative Perspective,Mousa Albashrawi,"June 2017,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3084381.3084405,"Increasingly, smartphones and mobile commerce are changing consumer transaction behaviors and shifting the ways in which users interact with business. Similarly, the banking and financial industry is now empowered by FinTech applications to improve their consumer experience and banking services to solidify the role for mobile banking (MB) for years to come. In this study, we are taking an integrated approach by combining two IT adoption models: UTAUT and IS Success, and using both subjective and objective measures for mobile banking usage. Our regression results for a sample of 472 bank users in a mid-size US bank find a strong support for satisfaction, objective actual use, and loyalty but not for subjective actual use. These results provide interesting implications for both IS adoption theory and banking institutions for improving satisfaction and use of MB."
IT Enabled Frugal Effectuation,Prem B. Khanal,"June 2017,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3084381.3084396,"To succeed, entrepreneurs operating in frugal contexts tend to adopt an effectual logic of action. Such entrepreneurs also increasingly rely on digital technologies to pursue opportunities.Yet, despite a flurry of scholarly attention to effectuation tactics and their outcomes, surprisingly little is known about how digital technologies support effectuation, and with what outcomes. This paper sketches a theoretical model of how IT affordances support effectuation in frugal contexts.The model extends entrepreneurship and information systems theories of frugal entrepreneurship by linking specific IT affordances to dimensions of effectuation. The paper also discusses how the model could be refined by empirical studies and extended across levels of analysis."

Effects of Organization Insiders' Self-Control and Relevant Knowledge on Participation in Information Systems Security Deviant Behavior: [Best Paper Nominee],Princely Ifinedo,"June 2017,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3084381.3084384,"Disastrous consequences tend to befall organizations whose employees participate in information systems security deviant behavior (ISSDB) (e.g., connecting computers to the Internet through an insecure wireless network and opening emails from unverified senders). Although organizations recognize that ISSDB poses a serious problem, understanding what motivates its occurrence continues to be a key concern. While studies on information technology (IT) misuse abounds, research specifically focusing on the drivers of ISSDB remains scant in the literature. Using self-control theory, augmented with knowledge of relevant factors, this study examined the effects of employees' self-control, knowledge of computers/IT, and information systems (IS) security threats and risks on participation in ISSDB. A research model, including the aforementioned factors, was proposed and tested using the partial least squares technique. Data was collected from a survey of Canadian professionals. The results show that low self-control and lower levels of knowledge of computers/IT are related to employees' involvement in ISSDB. The data did not provide a meaningful relationship between employees' knowledge of IS security threats/risks and desire to participate in ISSDB."

Would Technology Obliterate Medical Transcription?: The Antecedents and Consequences of Technology-driven Obsolescence Perceptions on Turnover Intentions of Medical Transcriptionists,S. Balaji,"June 2017,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3084381.3084414,"Increasingly, the adoption of speech recognition technology (SRT ) by various hospitals has posed a threat to the medical transcription profession. As turnover intentions among medical transcriptionists are on the rise, understanding the role of technology in shaping turnover intentions requires attention, and yet is a significant gap in the literature. Drawing upon the theories of stress and turnover intentions, and prior work on professional obsolescence, we propose a new construct called technology-driven obsolescence perceptions in the medical transcription domain. We posit that technology-driven obsolescence perceptions positively impact turnover intentions, and antecedents such as work-family conflict, fairness of rewards, work excellence and job commitment have differential impacts on technology-driven obsolescence perceptions. Results indicate that all the hypotheses in the study are supported. Our study makes important contributions to the obsolescence and turnover intentions literature, and has important implications for research and practice alike."

Social Movements in the Age of Social Media: A Structural and Content-based Analysis,Pratik Tarafdar,"June 2017,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3084381.3084406,"A wave of protest movements in recent years leveraging the potential of social media reveals the evolution in the process of collective identity in social networks, including the radical shift in the content and semantics of protest identity. The interplay of social media with social movements needs to be studied not only by illuminating the structural notion of networks in digital activism but also the actual content that flows through the medium such as the discourses and the iconographies pertaining to the social movement. With an aim to achieve this understanding, we propose a generic framework for the study of social media movements focusing on structure and content of social networks specifically characteristics such as homophily, structural capital and media richness along with the process of resource mobilization. We suggest a mixed-method approach to help answer the proposed research questions and validate the framework. The paper also discusses possible implications for research and practice."
The Impact of Social Media as Technostress Inhibitor on Employee Productivity,Anupriya Khan,"June 2017,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3084381.3084407,"The positive and negative sides of information technology and systems are of interest to the researchers across different domains. Technostress, being a negative and unintended consequence rendered by the use of various information systems, has recently obtained significant attention in the information systems (IS) literature. It has been demonstrated in various studies how technostress affects the overall organizational performance by increasing role stress and reducing employees' job satisfaction, productivity, and performance. We extend the existing literature on technostress by reasoning that certain information technologies (IT) and systems may induce technostress that can be inhibited by certain other IT and systems such as social media. Drawing on coping theory, we explain the role of social media as technostress inhibitor. We thus provide the research model depicting the moderating role of social media, in which, we posit that the negative impact of technostress creators on employee productivity can be mitigated by the use of social media. We also provide the potential implications of the study and outline the research methodology that will be taken up in the next stage of our present research."

Medappa,"June 2017,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3084381.3084410,"Digitally enabled transformations have allowed organizations and individuals to adopt open source as a viable mode of software development. In fact, organizations are increasingly moving away from traditional licenses in favor of open source licenses. However, extant literature reports conflicting findings regarding the impact of different open source licenses on the success of the project. Through this research, we attempt to reconcile the conflicting findings in literature by providing a more nuanced understanding of the mechanisms through which the type of license influences the success of the project. Using propensity score matching and ordinary least squares regression analysis on a sample of 2110 organization owned open source projects, we compare the structures of work across the two main types of licenses and study its relation to the success of the project. The results of our analysis indicate that different motivational mechanisms are at play under different licenses, which in turn has an influence on the optimal structures of work for a particular license. From these results we conclude that the success of the project depends on how well the structures of work are aligned to the motivational requirements created by the license. The findings provide significant insights for open source researchers and organizations as to how they can model the structures of work to facilitate the success of open source projects."
When Do Vendors Behave Opportunistically?: An Empirical Study of Financial Market Impacts on Firms in IT Outsourcing Relationships,Rajiv Kishore,"June 2017,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3084381.3084387,"Firms experience knowledge spillovers when working with outsourcing partners. This problem may be more severe when a firm and its rivals enter into outsourcing relationships with the same vendor. In such a network of outsourcing relationships, the common vendor may become the conduit for knowledge leakage from one firm to the other due to its own opportunistic calculus. Rooted in transaction cost economics (TCE), we propose that a vendor will utilize the knowledge gained from focal or rival firms whenever it is in the interest of the vendor to do so, resulting in losses or gains to rivals of a focal firm when the focal firm announces a new contract with the common vendor. Using a sample of 510 IT outsourcing contract announcements, we observed such losses and gains through cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) that accrue to rival firms around the date of announcement of a new IT outsourcing contract by a focal firm. Results support our hypotheses and show negative CARs for rivals that in the past had a relationship with the focal vendor but do not have a current relationship with the vendor. We also find that the rival firm size relative to the focal firm size plays an important role in vendor calculus and resulting knowledge spillovers. Knowledge leaks from a rival to a focal firm, and the rival experiences a negative CAR, when the rival is relatively larger in size compared to the focal firm and is no longer in a relationship with the vendor. However, in contrast, when the rival is relatively larger in size compared to the focal firm and is currently in a relationship with the vendor, knowledge leaks from the focal firm to the rival who experiences a positive CAR."
Framework for Alignment of Service Provider Value Drivers with Client Expectations in IT Services Outsourcing,Arup K.

However, there are variations in value delivery as per client expectations. It is critical to understand how alignment can be achieved between B-to-B client and vendor organizations to minimize this variation. Through dyadic case studies, this research paper develops a framework of (mis)aligned practices at three levels of conceptualization- contractual alignment, knowledge alignment and business alignment. Further, a project alignment measurement framework has been developed along with propositions for future study. This research adopted a practice based analyses of organizations Findings from data collected through interviews and project documentations resulted in nineteen practices showing aligned behaviors and twenty-three practices showing mis-aligned behaviors at contractual alignment level; six practices showing aligned behaviors and eleven practices showing mis-aligned behaviors at knowledge alignment level; and fourteen practices showing aligned behaviors and eleven practices showing mis-aligned behaviors at business alignment level"

Exploring Critical Issues of Technical Support in Contact Centers of the Philippines: Toward a Grounded Theory,Meldie Apag,"June 2017,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3084381.3084383,"The contact center industry in the Philippines, named by Deloitte as one of the two top contact center destinations in Asia, has been expanding rapidly in terms of technology, workforce size, and economic scope. This study aims to explore, using the Glaserian grounded theory method (GTM), the main concern of contact center agents, particularly inbound technical support representatives, in Northern Mindanao in the Philippines, and how they resolve their main concern, especially using information technology. GTM goes beyond the descriptive approach of most qualitative methods by generating from the data, a theory of the substantive area. The rationale for GTM reflects the source of the developed theory grounded in the behavior, words, and actions of those under study. The theory can inform the development of systems, processes, structures, and policies that will support the actors in the substantive area. Preliminary results suggest that staying at the organization or else seeking other employment opportunities is the main concern of the technical support representatives, who resolve this main concern using a cyclical process, each cycle of which has four stages: training, struggling, coping, and motivating. The application of technologies in contact center operations can play a key role in sustaining the technical support representatives' decision to stay longer in the industry."

Institutional Isomorphism due to the Influence of Information Systems and Its Strategic Position,Abhipsa Pal,"June 2017,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3084381.3084395,"Institutional isomorphism is a concept at the core of institutional theory to explain the homogeneity of organizations in a field. DiMaggio and Powell (1983) developed a framework that presented the different mechanisms, including coercive, mimetic and normative, through which isomorphism occurs. Information systems (IS) have become a critical asset in the industry today, with firms heavily dependent on IS for either their day-to-day operational processes or to gain a strategic edge. This paper proposes that IS drives isomorphism in organizations. The IS impact affecting isomorphism is greater when the dependence of the firm on information technology is greater. McFarlan and McKenney's (1983) IS strategic grid identifies four kinds of IS dependence' strategic, turnaround, operational, and support. We propose a framework to understand the degree of isomorphism (through different mechanisms) that a firm is likely to experience under the influence of IS, based on the firm's position in the strategic grid. There has been studies linking institutional theory and strategic IT, and evidences of importance of such research, but none of the studies develops a framework observing the mechanisms of isomorphism due to IT impact. The paper analyses relevant cases from the industry using a framework that we developed. The framework has practical implications for firms to be prepared for the isomorphic changes they are expected to experience when their IS dependence places them in a particular strategic quadrant."
Executive Pay Before and After Technology IPOs: Who Receives More?,Tenace Kwaku Setor,"June 2017,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3084381.3084397,"Technology IPOs expose Information Technology (IT) firms to significant challenges that are fundamentally different from those faced during the founding or startup stage. To tackle the post-IPO challenges, IT firms pay premium wages to hire professional executives from the external labor market rather than from within. Yet, how the executive pay of external hires compares to that of internal hires when IT firms mark significant milestones in their lifecycle remain understudied. The current study therefore examines the pay of internal and external hires and place it within the context of the IPO timeline i.e. pre- and post-IPO. By analyzing data from multiple sources using a linear mixed effects modelling technique, we find that IT firms pay internal hires significantly higher than external hires in the pre-IPO stage. In the post-IPO stage, IT firms pay external hires significantly higher than internal hires. We discuss the implications of the findings on theory and practice."
Influence of R&D and IPR regulations on the performance of IT firms in India: An Empirical Analysis using Tobin's Q Approach,Senthilkumar Thangavelu,"June 2017,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3084381.3084400,"Influence of Research and Development (R&D), as well as regulation on the performance of the industry, is known. However, in a stronger property regime R&D activities become more focused, and innovation-oriented that result in better performance in the organization. Information Technology (IT) industry being the front runner of the knowledge economy is driven by innovation, which in turn reflects on its performance. This quest led us to not only understand the separate influence of R&D and intellectual property rights regulations but also the interaction of both on the performance of IT firms. This paper, in the context of India, investigates the effects of R&D intensity, implementation of WTO-TRIPS agreement and their interaction, on the performance of Information Technology (IT) firms in India. We included some firm-specific controls to reduce their effects on the performance. The performance is measured using Tobin's Q. Firm-level data from Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. Ltd (CMIE) Prowess database for the period 2000-2016 are used. An empirical study is conducted using unbalanced time series data and Random-effects GLS regression method with and without controls and interaction. Our results suggest that the IT firm's performance increases with increase in the R&D intensity when interacted with World Trade Organization -- Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (WTO-TRIPS)."

Privacy Protection Dashboard: A Study of Individual Cloud-Storage Users Information Privacy Protection Responses,Surya Karunagaran,"June 2017,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3084381.3084424,"Cloud computing services have gained a lot of attraction in the recent years, but the shift of data from user-owned desktops and laptops to cloud storage systems has led to serious data privacy implications for the users. Even though privacy notices supplied by the cloud vendors details the data practices and options to protect their privacy, the lengthy and free-flowing textual format of the notices are often difficult to comprehend by the users. Thus we propose a simplified presentation format for privacy practices and choices termed as ""Privacy-Dashboard"" based on Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and we intend to test the effectiveness of presentation format using cognitive-fit theory. Also, we indirectly model the cloud privacy concerns using Item-Response Theory (IRT) model. We contribute to the information privacy literature by addressing the literature gap to develop privacy protection artifacts in order to improve the privacy protection behaviors of individual users. The proposed ""privacy dashboard"" would provide an easy-to-use choice mechanisms that allow consumers to control how their data is collected and used."
Real-Time Decision-Making to Serve the Unbanked Poor in the Developing World,Lakshmi Mohan,"June 2017,",https://doi.org/10.1145/3084381.3084425,"The World Bank estimated in 2015 that 60% of the world's poor earning less than USD2.00 a day do not have a bank account or are unbanked. A major impediment to serve the unbanked poor is the high cost of the process of distributing small loans and collecting repayments from barely literate borrowers. This process requires loan officers to meet the poor at their door step, making it a people-intensive process requiring frequent face-to-face interaction. Real-time decision-making is a solution to address the key challenge experienced by banks when serving the unbanked poor in the developing word. Our poster is drawn from two case examples: Banco Azteca, a bank in Mexico, and Equitas Holdings Limited that makes small amounts of loans to unbanked poor in India. We focus on an Azteca's automated decision support system to serve low income people ignored by banks in Mexico, and a real-time performance dashboard custom-built by Equitas to improve the productivity of loan officers. Our analysis suggests that real-time decision making cannot enable banks to scale their operations for achieving significant social impact unless the following conditions are met: process, application of real time data, user friendly interfaces, and leadership by top management."

SEIS is also modeled as a mediator between factors affecting SEIS and the end user cybersecurity behavior. However, it is not clearly established in past literature on whether SEIS is better modeled as a predictor or as a mediator. It is stressed in literature that we should find new ways to improve SEIS. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to empirically investigate what factors influence SEIS, and to examine the relative effect of each theorized factor (including self-efficacy) in increasing information security."
Virtual World Consumer Behavior,Angie M. Cox,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2906192,"This research will look at consumer behaviors in Virtual Worlds (VW) in order to fill the research gap and build a model to explain why users chose to purchase in VWs. Results from this study will help Information Systems (IS) researchers and game developers understand specific user attributes that may affect their intentions to purchase. With this knowledge IS researchers and developers may have the opportunity to manipulate system components in ways to improve business processes and stimulate profits for businesses. This study will rely on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), Flow Theory and the concept of desire for uniqueness (DFU). The study's data will come from online survey volunteer VW users in one region of the United States testing both the model's measurement tool and hypotheses with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with Partial Least Squares (PLS). The validity and reliability and the strength and polarity relationships between the variables (user skill, challenge and DFU; VW shopping attitude, subjective norms (SN); and VW purchase intentions) will be assessed. With the results of the study, suggestions for further research will be made."

Prominent among this stream of research are studies that have examined IT human capital endowments as determinants of IT career success and mobility patterns of IT professionals as they traverse career paths. According to Joseph, Boh, Ang and Slaughter's analysis of 500 IT professionals drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey for Youth 1979 cohort dataset, IT career paths are more diverse than the traditional view of technical vs managerial career paths. The career histories of IT professionals revealed three distinct career paths i.e. IT careers, Professional Labor Market (PLM) and Secondary Labor Market (SLM). IT professionals who took the IT and PLM career paths enjoyed more career success in terms of pay received relative to those who took the SLM route."

Providers' Perceptions of the Impact of Weight Loss Apps on Users with Eating Disorders,Elizabeth V. Eikey,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2906194,"It is estimated that 30 million people in the United States have an eating disorder, and many more have unhealthy eating behaviors [5]. In addition to being psychological in nature, eating disorders are a social problem driven by the mass media promotion of the ""thin ideal"" [6]. More researchers have recognized the importance of studying technology on users' body image and eating behaviors [1, 4, 8, 9, 13]. Despite their popularity, few studies have considered the impact of health applications (""apps"") for weight loss on users with disordered eating behaviors. To begin to address this understudied area, I consider eating disorder treatment providers' perceptions of these apps. Some researchers have urged providers to be aware of the existence, possibilities, dysfunctions, and impact of technology in relation to eating disorders [23, 110]. Yet few studies consider providers' perceptions of weight loss apps and how they think about them when diagnosing and treating eating disorder patients."

Investigating the Role of Top Management and Institutional Pressures in Cloud Computing Adoption,Elston H. Steele,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2906197,"ABSTRACT While cloud computing adoption is on the rise, barriers continue to play a critical role in delaying the progress of some cloud computing adoption efforts. In 2010 the United States federal government launched the ""Cloud First"" policy which requires government agencies to consider the adoption of cloud computing when the solution is secure, reliable and cost effective (Kundra, 2010). Unfortunately, cloud computing adoption among federal agencies has been sluggish. This study investigates pressures asserted to facilitate cloud computing adoption. Although a vast amount of literature exists, very few studies empirically investigate cloud computing adoption from an institutional perspective in concert with top management support. This study aims to fill the gap where the literature is lacking concerning the adoption of cloud computing by federal agencies."
What is Missing for Trust in the Cloud Computing?,Teofilo Branco,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2890605,"This article deals with an analysis of some contracts Cloud Computing on the questions involved in the security of their environment. The objective of this study is to evaluate if the content of the contracts for the provision of IT services platforms in Computer Cloud includes, at present, the clauses necessary to transmit trust in relation the safety. The services must comply with the recommendations and with the security standards to convey reliability. Also is necessary to make indications about security's requirements in their contracts. This study analyzed through in a literature review, the standards and the recommendations proposed by groups of research and Cloud Computing regulatory entities and made a comparison with the contractual clauses published on the web by some suppliers of Cloud IT platforms. A comparison of these contracts with the recommendations of respected entities in the area of the security for consumption of this type of service shows that there is still a lot to improve in these agreements to clarify the aspects of the safety in a transparent way."

The Dual-sided Effect of Project Failure on IT Professionals,Christoph PflÃ¼gler,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2890610,"The effects of project failure on IT professionals have not received much attention in IT research. A failed project evokes negative emotions and therefore could trigger turnover, which has negative influences from the perspective of IT human resource management. However, the failure of IT projects could also have positive influences as professionals might learn from the failed project. This paper focuses on analyzing this dual-sided effect of project failure on IT professionals. We develop hypotheses that will be tested with a large data set from an IT service provider in future research. We expect to contribute to theory by analyzing whether project failure triggers turnover and by analyzing whether IT professionals learn from failed projects and perform better in the future."

The paper aims to provide a theoretical contribution to the research stream on the topic, by further exploring the emergent properties and understandings related to the role of CIO. As a consequence of the need to adopt advanced technologies, the CIO has been named to master the current unheard information growth for business innovation. To this end we present the results of a qualitative research based on grounded theory carried out on data concerning CIOs of medium and large companies from different industries in the Italian market. Finally, a substantive theory and categories are discussed, showing the role of generation gap and power of new entrants as well as of project and execution excellence on the making of identity and recognition of the CIO as relevant at the time of Big Data analytics."
"Is It All About Awareness?: People, Smart Cities 3.0, and Evolving Spaces for IT",H. Patricia McKenna,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2890612,"The purpose of this paper is to explore contemporary understandings of the smart city movement in relation to information technology (IT) transformations, specifically emerging aware technologies and the use of social media in urban spaces. Faced with rapid urban growth, cities are responding by innovating themselves to address the associated and unprecedented challenges and opportunities. This paper is significant in that it reaches across interdisciplinary domains, to shed light on awareness and the smart cities phenomena. The theoretical perspective for this work draws on material-discursive practices, practice theory, and a performative perspective in relation to IT transformations, smart cities, and awareness. The research design for this study employs an exploratory case study approach, a minimally viable social media space, and multiple methods of qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis. This paper focuses on two levels of analysis, the individual and the social, in contemporary urban environments. Anecdotal evidence from informal conversations conducted in parallel with this study supports further data analysis, comparison, and triangulation. Key findings are discussed in terms of awareness in relation to experiences of contemporary urban spaces based on the constructs of noticing, sensing, sharing, and smartness. The major contributions of this work include: further development of the research literature for awareness and for IT transformations in relation to smart cities; development, operationalization, and advancing of a conceptual framework for awareness in smart cities; and the identification of future directions for smart cities practitioners and researchers."
Promoting Physical Activity In Seniors: Future Opportunities with Emerging Technologies,Jake Araullo,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2890616,"High levels of physical inactivity that are trending upwards in the population present significant health challenges, particularly in seniors. Opportunities are present for emerging technologies to promote and engage seniors in physical activity, leading social change in this area, with a goal to boost quality-of-life, health, self-efficacy and autonomy in this growing segment of the population. Attitudes to emerging technology adoption, physical activity and behaviour change must be identified. This will allow the practical adoption of strategic information system implementations that can create meaningful, macro-level impacts in this in area of senior physical activity, as well as inform strategies and best practices for designers of information technology systems in this developing area."
The Sharing Economy: Studying Technology-Mediated Social Movements,Jonathan P. Allen,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2890609,"The sharing economy is a term used to describe an IT-fueled, rapidly growing social movement around collaborative consumption. This movement has the potential to significantly affect economic opportunity and broader culture. In this research- in-progress paper, we pose as a key question: how does technology mediation of the sharing economy movement change over time? What explains this change, and what difference does technology mediation make? We draw upon the concepts of technology mediation, and computerization movements, in two comparative industry case studies: car sharing, and room sharing. We outline future research steps, and begin the process of critically examining the role of IT in social movement mediation. Is the sharing economy likely to create positive new economic alternatives? Or is it simply another strategy to intensify the role of global finance in everyday life, and fuel the high rates of growth demanded by venture-backed technology startups?"
Empowering Deep Thinking to Support Critical Thinking in Teaching and Learning,Hisham Al-Mubaid,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2890606,"This research describes learning activities and techniques that improve deep and critical thinking among students. Critical thinking is considered an ultimate goal in MIS education; and learners who reach critical thinking level can achieve the highest learning goals and outcomes. Critical thinking and English communication are considered the two most essential competencies in the 21st century. Therefore, universities have invested significantly in understanding, promoting, and delivering critical thinking in education. Moreover, the learning and education research has invested extensively in critical thinking. In this research, we present and discuss seven learning activities and techniques that initiate deep thinking and promote critical thinking in teaching and learning in order to achieve high level of quality learning. The main focus of this work is in the higher education setting at the level of colleges and universities. We discuss and explain seven learning activities, with examples and tools that will help increase the level of thinking and improve higher order thinking and critical analysis. The presented techniques and examples can be easily applied and adapted into any discipline to help increase and improve higher order thinking among the learners. The preliminary evaluation results are very encouraging."
Defining Audience Awareness for Information Systems Research,Jordan Shropshire,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2890614,"Above all, information systems (IS) professionals must be effective communicators. After all, a core part of the job is to translate business needs into system requirements. Conveying information in the right form is essential. Effective IS professionals have refined social cognitive abilities. They consider their audience and tailor the content of their messages accordingly. This concept is called audience awareness. It is a manifestation of social cognition and a hallmark of strong communicators. Although the concept of audience awareness has been discussed in other contexts, it has never been used within the IS field. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to develop a conceptual definition of audience awareness so that it can be used for IS personnel research. The definition is derived inductively using a content-analytical approach. The definition is further refined and validated using an expert panel. Implications and future research are also discussed."
Black Lives Matter: The Journey of a Black IT Scholar,Curtis C.

The content of this paper was adapted from a dissertation that focused on identifying and analyzing the factors that support or undermine the achievement of Black males completing IT degrees and entering the workforce. The content of this paper centers around the factors that impacted the scholar. In light of the Black Lives Matter movement, we wanted to take a social issue and deconstruct it to apply it to academia. In order to accomplish this, we used a researcher's lived experiences as a Black male for the data for this paper. By the scholar's own admission, [blinded for review] has not reached the level of success that the scholar would like the scholar is still striving to reach those goals. These are goals that the likes of Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown, Dontre Hamilton, Eric Garner, John Crawford III, Ezell Ford and countless others no longer have, which sparked the Black Lives Matter movement."
Putting the Consequences of IT Turnover on the Map: A Review and Call for Research,MatthÃ¤us P. Zylka,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2890618,"Among the many aspects of IT personnel studied by the IS research community, individual voluntary IT turnover is one of the most-examined phenomena. However, research into this phenomenon concentrates mainly on antecedents and cognitive precursors such as turnover intention. Antecedents are essential to understanding the turnover of IT personnel, but they do not represent the complete landscape of IT turnover research. The consequences of individual voluntary IT turnover, an important topic, have received too little attention from the IS community. I investigate this by conducting a multidisciplinary literature review of individual voluntary turnover consequences of IT personnel. My review reveals that only 8 of 130 IT turnover studies consider IT turnover consequences, concentrated primarily on software project management. I present a taxonomy of individual voluntary IT turnover consequences as a starting point for structured research on the consequences of individual voluntary IT turnover."
Experienced Meaningfulness and Calling: Effects on IT Professionals' Retention Intention,Christine Koh,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2890615,"Research in the broader management and related fields have consistently highlighted the importance of calling and experienced meaningfulness of work on work outcomes. Interestingly, these concepts have made little in-roads into the field of IT research. In this paper, we propose that experienced meaningfulness and calling offer a new perspective to understand IT professionals' turnover and turnaway intentions. Drawing on extant theory, we hypothesize that experienced meaningfulness has a negative direct effect on both turnover and turnaway intentions. Calling, on the other hand, has a negative direct effect on turnaway intentions, but moderates the effect of experienced meaningfulness on turnover intentions. Results from our large-scale study showed support for the hypothesized relationships."
How Temporal Work Styles and Product Modularity Influence Software Quality and Job Satisfaction,Jens Foerderer,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2890608,"This paper investigates how two key outcomes in software development-software quality and job satisfaction of software developers-are influenced by product modularity and developers' temporal work style, i.e., the preferences for completing the bulk of work closer to the deadlines. We argue that high deadline orientation positively interacts with product modularity to influence software quality and job satisfaction of developers. An empirical test using a unique data set on more than 140 software developers working at a large global software vendor confirms our hypotheses. We contribute to the literature on software development by showing that software quality and job satisfaction can be increased by matching the fit between technological characteristics of the software product and people factors (i.e., the preferred temporal work style of developers). Our study has wider implications for literature on temporal work styles and product modularity and can be informative for practitioners who are tasked with hiring or allocating software developers for software products with varying modularity."

The paper includes results from 38 articles outlining the existing body of knowledge and showing the steady progress in this research field. Previous literature often thematizes the external use of social media and technological aspects, but this research concentrates on the internal collaborative use, its challenges, related determinants, managerial implications and its impact on business. Existing research illustrates key factors in each of the previously mentioned subjects. However, as research should consider the entire field, a research agenda for further studies in this ESM topic is developed."

Evaluating Effective Use of Social Networks for Recruitment,Malmi Amadoru,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2890604,"Social media applications and services have become popular over the years and organizations are increasingly exploiting social media related services in business functions. Human resource recruiting is one such function, which has stepped into a new era of social recruitments. Talent sourcing plays a major role in any organization as recruiting competent people with right skills for right positions leads organizations to achieve their vision, mission, and objectives. Therefore, it is important for organizations to adopt innovative recruitment techniques. As organizations are increasingly exploiting social networks for recruitment, it is important to research and evaluate how useful social networks are as a recruitment tool and how it can be used effectively. The main objective of this study was to evaluate social networks as a recruitment tool for HR professionals and identify effective uses of social networks for recruitments. The research shows that process efficiency, reachability and passive talent attraction can be identified as effective uses of social networks for recruitment."
College-Based Career Experiences as Determinants of IT Labor Market Entry: A Survival Analysis Model,Tenace Setor,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2890607,"Novice IT professionals are not well-endowed with experience and professional knowledge-attributes gained in the course of IT work-which could facilitate labor market outcomes such as entering the IT workforce immediately after completing college education. However, college-based career experiences such as job shadowing, mentorship, internships and cooperative education are valuable sources of human capital which can engender good future performance and productivity; and, thus, can often decide the employment fate of novice IT professionals. The current study draws on human capital theory and develop a set of hypotheses relating college-based career experiences to the likelihood of securing IT jobs. We test our hypotheses using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 cohort. We find that hands-on forms of college-based career experiences such internships and cooperative education increase the likelihood of securing IT jobs immediately after completing college. We do not find support for vicarious forms of college-based career experiences i.e. mentorship and job shadowing. We discuss the implications of our results on research and practice."
Designing Games for Presence in Consumer Virtual Reality,Lewis Carter,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2890626,"With virtual reality technologies entering the consumer market this year, it is the task of those producing content for the virtual reality platform to ensure that users have an experience that lives up to expectations. Virtual reality comes with its own strengths and weaknesses, and these must be taken into account when designing applications to produce the best possible experience for interaction. This paper employs a qualitative case study to examine participants in sessions with a virtual reality game prototype utilizing the Oculus Rift. The game prototype was designed to investigate problem areas of virtual reality. Data was then analyzed through thematic analysis, and a preliminary set of game design heuristics specific to virtual reality were created. These heuristics are written so that virtual reality game designers can easily apply them."
New Product Diffusion: The Role of Sentiment Content,Tung Cu,"June 2016,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2890602.2890627,The current study is focusing on diffusion and adoption of new digital artifacts. The goal is to explore the social role of user-generated content (UGC) during the diffusion process of digital products in the context of online social networks. Data collection is conducted on 154 new digital products during a two-year timeframe. Results of the study provide a deeper insight into the influence of textual UGC sentiment on new product diffusion and how such a web system (i.e.: online social networks) can help to enable a process of value co-creation. The overall finding shows that Volume of Post and UGC Sentiment have a dynamic impact on Diffusion (Adoption Rate) of digital products.

The proposal will highlight the need for research in the area of crowdsourcing as a mechanism to enhance and expand the technology workforce. It does so by examining the technology crowdsourcing phenomenon from three perspectives: the worker (or labor supply), the buyer of technology services (or labor demand) and the marketplaces that facilitates the buyer-seller transaction. It will explore how workforce development and enterprise readiness theories can be applied in explaining how crowdsourcing can be applied to technology tasks. This dissertation will be structured in a three study format. Study one will explore the technology crowdsourcing phenomenon from a ""crowdworker"" perspective. This study will examine technology crowdwork from a career anchors perspective, and will highlight the potential role of crowdsourcing in expanding the technology workforce to additional sources of worker capacity. This study will establish the theories that describe the motivations and outcomes achieved by workers in crowdsourcing project engagements, and utilize Schein's Career Anchors (Schein 1990) to examine the motivations of workers technology enabled collaborative work environments. Study two will focus on the perceptions and readiness for crowdsourcing labor on the part of buyers of IT services. The research will collect survey data regarding enterprise readiness, and will examine the current state of enterprise readiness to adopt new development techniques. Study three will utilize a design science perspective to examine the ability of crowdsourcing marketplace platforms to meet the needs of IT service buyers and IT service workers as identified in Study's one and two."
The Impact of Positive Informal Behaviors on the Effectiveness of Information Systems Departments,Hadi Karimikia,"June 2015,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2751957.2755505,"Good relationships between information systems (IS) and business employees build shared understanding and cross-domain knowledge, and enhance the level of business-IS alignment in an organization. Most researchers have focused on improving the quality and frequency of communication, and less work has been done on the informal activities IS staff carry out to aid their non-IS colleagues. This limited attention on the behaviors of IS employees restricts our understanding of how positive interaction between IS and non-IS employees can be encouraged and how it affects the effectiveness of an IS department. Drawing on the concept of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), we derive a set of IS-specific OCBs by reviewing the literature and relate them to characteristics of IS departments and IS employees. Our research questions are: a) When are IS professionals more likely to engage in IS-specific OCBs? b) What is the impact of IS-specific OCBs on the effectiveness of the IS department?"
Complexity Reduction in Information Security Risk Assessment,Glourise M. Haya,"June 2015,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2751957.2755506,"Results of research done by Dlamini et al. [5] clearly show information security was once focused around technical issues. However, over time, that approach transitioned to a more strategic governance model where legal and regulatory compliance, risk management, and digital forensics disciplines became the significant contributors in the domain. This focus has resulted in a proliferation of information security risk assessment models, which on the whole, have not necessarily helped to reduce risks or appropriately respond to security events. This research seeks to develop a new information security risk assessment model through the aggregation of existing models."
Personal Information Sharing with Major User Concerns in the Online B2C Market: A Social Contract Theory Perspective,John R. Magrane,"June 2015,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2751957.2755507,"The cyber world has seen growth in the online business over the past two decades and e-commerce continues to expand. Moreover it has brought ease and comfort in the lives of the people and now there is no distinction of states and regions. Mainstream people can buy anything from anywhere in the world through web-platforms such as Amazon.com, thus enhancing e-commerce. However, the major concern that arises is the security apprehension. This research paper studies the willingness of the online shopper to disclose personal information. The study will use a conceptual model to examine customers' online activities and how variables such as user trust, knowledge sharing behavior, and loyalty intentions influence users' privacy concerns, and further moderated by one's perceived environmental security in the B2C Internet market. Social Contract Theory (SCT) will be used to analyze the issue in the behavioral perspective, based on the human obligations towards one another and on the state as the supreme authority that establishes the principles that maintain the balance of a society."

Video Games as a Training Tool to Prepare the Next Generation of Cyber Warriors,Christopher Herr,"June 2015,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2751957.2751958,"There is a global shortage of more than 1 million skilled cybersecurity professionals needed to address current cybersecurity challenges [5]. Criminal organizations, nation-state adversaries, hacktavists, and numerous other threat actors continuously target business, government, and even critical infrastructure networks. Estimated losses from cyber crime and cyber espionage amount to hundreds of billions annually [4]. The need to build, maintain, and defend computing resources is greater than ever before. A novel approach to closing the cybersecurity workforce gap is to develop cutting-edge cybersecurity video games that (1) grab the attention of young adults, (2) build a solid foundation of information security knowledge and skills, (3) inform players of potential career paths, and (4) establish a passion that drives them through higher education and professional growth. Although some video games and other games do exist, no viable options are available that target high-school-age students and young adults that supply both a quality gaming experience and foster the gain of key cybersecurity knowledge and skills. Given the Department of Defense's success with simulations and gaming technology, its sponsorship of a cybersecurity video game could prove extremely valuable in addressing the current and future needs for our next generation cyber warriors."
A Vignette-based Method for Improving Cybersecurity Talent Management through Cyber Defense Competition Design,David H.

The first year of the study focused on identifying the abilities that should indicate aptitude to perform well in the areas of operational security testing and advanced threat response. A recently developed method for Job Performance Modeling (JPM) is applied which uses vignettes -- critical incident stories -- to guide the elicitation of a holistic description of mission-critical roles grounded in the latest tactics, techniques and protocols defining the current state-of-the-art, or ground truth, in cyber defense. Implications are drawn for design of scoring engines and achievement of game balance in cyber defense competitions as a talent management system."

Yet, the under-representation of women, Latinos and African Americans has persisted in the field. In this study, we focus on African American male undergraduates majoring in information technology (IT). Despite the bleak numbers of African American males in IT there are still those who persist and graduate from a university and enter the workforce. To gain insights into those who do persist, we used a digital inequality framework to inform a qualitative study of undergraduates at two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). We conducted interviews with 20 African American males to uncover factors that contribute to their choice to pursue an IT major. The findings reveal that the five constructs from this framework (technical apparatus, digital skill, social support, autonomy of use, and purpose of use) in addition to two new constructs (work ethic and IT career exposure) help to explain how and why African American males choose IT majors. The study contributes to the limited literature on African American men's academic success, and helps to clarify some of the mixed and contradictory findings about their career choices that exist in the current literature."
Does Competitor Grade Level Influence Perception of Cybersecurity Competition Design Gender Inclusiveness?,Jason M. Pittman,"June 2015,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2751957.2751974,"Lack of gender diversity is a recognized issue within STEM. As a result, much effort has been invested in alternative means of recruitment and education. One example are cybersecurity competitions serving as popular training mechanisms. Yet, earlier research found that competitors perceive these competitions to be designed in a non-gender inclusive manner. The prior work did not consider potential biases in competitors however. Motivationally, future competition design may be misguided if competitors' perceptions were skewed due to exposure and social desirability. This led to the general question of whether grade level is related to identification of such competitions as non-gender inclusive in design. Accordingly, this study measured if U.S. collegiate upperclassmen and underclassmen participating in competitions are equally likely to identify cybersecurity competitions as non-gender inclusive. To that end, a chi-square statistic was used to compare the rates of identification of competition design gender inclusiveness amongst 104 cyber competitors. The results of the analysis indicated that upperclassmen are no more likely than underclassmen to identify a cybersecurity competition as non-gender inclusive. Thus, gender non-inclusiveness of competitions may be inherent in the design of such as opposed to a subjective experience of competitors."

Characterizing the Traits of Top-Performing Security Personnel,Jordan Shropshire,"June 2015,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2751957.2751971,"Organizational information security is a talent-centric proposition. Information assurance is a product of the combined expertise, attention-to-detail, and creativity of an information security team. A competitive edge can be obtained by hiring the top information security professionals. Therefore, identifying the right people is a mission-critical task. To assist in the candidate selection process, this research analyzes the enduring traits of top security performers. Specifically, it evaluates the Big Five Model of personality and the Six Workplace Values. In a laboratory study, 62 undergraduates majoring in information assurance completed a series of simulations which assessed their ability to solve various information security problems. The characteristics of top information security performers were contrasted against the rest of the cohort. In terms of personality, the top performers have high levels of conscientiousness and openness. With respect to workplace values, the top performers have a stronger preference for theoretical endeavors such as the pursuit of truth."
Lessons from the Strategic Corporal: Implications of Cyber Incident Response,Antoine Lemay,"June 2015,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2751957.2751965,"With the rise of cyber espionage the role of cyber incident responders is becoming more complex, but the personnel profile of incident handlers has remained constant. In this new environment, the strategic position of companies is being affected by operation personnel, including cyber incident responders, who have little to no awareness of the strategic implications of their technical decisions. In recent decades, the military has gone through a similar situation and has dubbed this new reality the ""Strategic Corporal"". This paper analyzes cyber incident response through the theoretical framework of the Strategic Corporal to argue that today's cyber incident responders fit that profile. The paper looks at three solutions put forward by the military, namely training, communication of the commander's intent and embracing decentralization, and shows that these are viable solutions to make cyber incident responders ready to meet the current challenge."
What Skills do you Need to Work in Cyber Security?: A Look at the Australian Market,Leigh Ellen Potter,"June 2015,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2751957.2751967,"The demand for cyber security professionals is rising as the incidence of cyber crime and security breaches increases, leading to suggestions of a skills shortage in the technology industry. While supply and demand are factors in the recruitment process for any position, in order to secure the best people in the security field we need to know what skills are required to be a security professional in the current cyber security environment. This paper seeks to explore this question by looking at the current state of the Australian Industry. Recent job listings in the cyber security area were analysed, and current security professionals in industry were asked for their opinion as to what skills were required in this profession. It was found that each security professional role has its own set of skill requirements, however there is significant overlap between the roles for many soft skills, including analysis, consulting and process skills, leadership, and relationship management. Both communication and presentation skills were valued. A set of ""hard"" skills emerged as common across all categories: experience, qualifications and certifications, and technical expertise. These appear to represent the need for a firm background in the security area as represented by formal study and industry certifications, and supported by solid experience in the industry. Specific technical skills are also required, although the exact nature of these will vary according to the requirements of each role."

IT Surveillance and Social Implications in the Workplace,Mohammad Mohammad,"June 2015,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2751957.2751959,"The workplace is where most adults spend roughly half of their waking hours. It is not surprising, therefore, that employment practices affect a broad range of privacy rights. With the exception of polygraph testing, there are few areas of workplace activities that are covered by the American constitution or privacy laws. Accordingly, employers have a great deal of leeway in collecting data on their employees, regulating access to personnel files, and disclosing file contents to outsiders. In addition to the issue of personnel files, workplace privacy involves such practices as polygraph testing, drug testing, computer and telephone monitoring, and interference with personal lifestyle. All of these practices stem from a combination of modern employer concerns employee theft, drug abuse, productivity, courtesy and the protection of trade secrets and technological advances that make it more economical to engage in monitoring and testing. The result for employees, however, is a dramatic increase in workplace surveillance. Unprecedented numbers of workers are urinating into bottles for employer run, drug-testing programs. Thousands of data entry operators have their every keystroke recorded by the very computers on which they are working. Surveillance is so thorough in some offices that employers can check to see exactly when employees leave their work stations to go to the bathroom and how long they take. A significant step toward resolving these issues can be taken by considering the possibilities and limitations posed by the extended use of surveillance and developing a model to balance these competing concerns. The model is proposed a master plan entitled ""Monitoring Process Model (MPM)"" showing the employers and employees and their inter-related activities. Which uses a thorough examination of the research literature, thus far to advocate the use of justifications for surveillance that Weigh Company interests against a notion of transactional privacy a form of privacy that focuses on trust and relationships."

This study explored Green IT awareness, adoption and practice of Green IT among the Indian students' at leading universities and colleges. This study also explored the willingness of Indian students to pay for Green IT. Descriptive statistics, independent-samples t-test and Factor analysis were used to analyze the data. Findings suggest that Indian students are adequately aware of the terms related to Green IT and the specific reasons for its adoption. Moreover, results suggest that Indian students follow Green IT practices; largely dominated by those practices which promote ""reducing paper consumption"". However, there exist a significant percentage of Indian students who are willing to adopt Green IT, but the relatively higher cost of adoption seems to be an inhibitor."

Words communicated online as action cues can provide indications of an actor's behavioral intent. This paper describes an ongoing investigation into the impact of a deceptive insider on group dynamics in virtual team collaboration. An experiment using an online game environment was conducted in 2014. Our findings support the hypothesis that language-action cues of group interactions will change significantly after an insider has been compromised and makes efforts to deceive. Furthermore, the language used in group dynamic interaction will tend to employ more cognition, inclusivity and exclusivity words when interacting with each other and with the focal insider. Future work will employ finely tuned complex Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count dictionaries to identify additional language-action cues for deception."
An Efficient Approach to Develop an Intrusion Detection System Based on Multi Layer Backpropagation Neural Network Algorithm: IDS using BPNN Algorithm,Rinku Sen,"June 2015,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2751957.2751979,"The key success factor of the business depends upon correct and timely information.

Among many threats of network security, intrusion has become a crucial reason for many organizations to incur loss. Many researchers are trying their level best to handle the different types of intrusion affecting the business. To detect such a type of intrusion, our initiative is to us a very popular soft computing tool namely back propagation neural network (BPNN). We have prepared a flexible BPNN architecture to identify the intrusion with the help of anomaly detection methodology.

"Professional Obsolescence in IT: The Relationships between the Threat of Professional Obsolescence, Coping and Psychological Strain.",Tenace Setor,"June 2015,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2751957.2751962,"Professional obsolescence has been recognized as one of the biggest threats confronting present day IT workers. Despite the imperative to understand the strategies for coping with this professional threat, research on the subject is relatively limited. Moreover, most studies on the subject till date are anecdotal. Clearly, theoretically grounded empirical research on the subject will not only help advance the understanding on professional obsolescence but will also provide actionable directions for IT professionals to work effectively. With this end in view we first draw upon the mediational model of occupational stress to theorize the relationships between the threat of professional obsolescence and problem-focused and emotion-focused coping and their consequent impacts on psychological strain. Next, we test the hypothesized model via survey data collected in two waves from a sample of 738 IT professionals from a large Indian IT company. Results show that the threat of professional obsolescence is positively related to problem-focused coping but not emotion-focused coping. In addition, emotion-focused coping of professional obsolescence is associated with higher levels of psychological strain, but problem-focused coping of professional obsolescence is not significantly associated with psychological strain. We discuss the implications that the results of this study have for theory and practice."
Extending Moore's Exhaustion Model: Including Further Dimensions of Burnout and Investigating Their Influence on Turnover Intention Among IT Professionals,Christoph Weinert,"June 2015,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2751957.2751975,"This research focuses on burnout as a driver of turnover intention amongst IT professionals. We extend Moore's exhaustion model by including further dimensions of burnout into the model, namely depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment. The effect of stressors on these dimensions and the original dimension of emotional exhaustion is investigated, as is their influence on turnover intention among IT professional. Results based on a data sample of 154 IT professionals show that not only emotional exhaustion but also depersonalization leads to turnover intention. This outcome cannot be neglected when trying to reduce turnover intention in an organization in order to maintain competitive advantages. Moreover, while the stressors suggested by Moore influence emotional exhaustion, they only slightly explain the dimensions of depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment. This indicates that these two dimensions of burnout are caused by additional factors, which represents a research gap worth investigating in future research."

Research from industry has reported that the majority of security-related problems are indirectly caused by employees who disobey the information security policies of their organizations. This study proposes a model to evaluate the factors that influence the individual's information security practices (IISP) at work. Drawing on social cognitive and control theories, the proposed model includes cognitive, environmental, and control factors as antecedents of ISSP. The findings of this study could be used to develop effective security policies and training. They could also be used to develop effective security audits and further recommendations for organizations that are looking to make significant improvements in their information security profiles"
Cracks in the Security Foundation: Employee Judgments about Information Sensitivity,Michelle L. Kaarst-Brown,"June 2015,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2751957.2751977,"Despite the increased focus on IT security, much of our reliance on ""information sensitivity classifications"" is based on broadly specified technical ""access controls"" or policies and procedures for the handling of organizational data -- many of them developed incrementally over decades. One area ignored in research and practice is how human beings make ""sensitivity judgments"" or ""classify"" information they may encounter in everyday activities. This has left what we view as a crack in the IT security foundation. This crack has created a tension between formal IT security classification schema, technical controls, and policy, and the sensitivity judgments that everyday workers must make about the non-coded information they deal with. As noted in government and private reports, a new look at information sensitivity classification is vital to the expanding reach and criticality of information security. Based on a grounded theory study that elicited 188 judgements of sensitive information, we found valuable lessons for IT security in how workers, both in IT and outside of IT, recognize, classify, and react to their human judgments of sensitive information."

Using Stakeholder Knowledge for Data Quality Assessment in IS Security Risk Management Processes,Christian Sillaber,"June 2015,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2751957.2751960,"The availability of high quality documentation of the IS as well as knowledgeable stakeholders are an important prerequisite for successful IS security risk management processes. However, little is known about the relationship between stakeholders, their knowledge about the IS, security documentation and how quality aspects influence the security and risk properties of the IS under investigation. We developed a structured data quality assessment process to identify quality issues in the security documentation of an information system. For this, organizational stakeholders were interviewed about the IS under investigation and models were created from their description in the context of an ongoing security risk management process process. Then, the research model was evaluated in a case study. We found that contradictions between the models created from stakeholder interviews and those created from documentation were a good indicator for potential security risks. The findings indicate that the proposed data quality assessment process provides valuable inputs for the ongoing security and risk management process. While current research considers users as the most important resource in security and risk management processes, little is known about the hidden value of various entities of documentation available at the organizational level. This study highlights the importance of utilizing existing IS security documentation in the security and risk management process and provides risk managers with a toolset for the prioritization of security documentation driven improvement activities."
"Maintaining Cyber Security: Implications, Cost and Returns",Nishtha Kesswani,"June 2015,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2751957.2751976,"ABSTRACT Cyber security is one of the most critical issues that are faced globally by most of the countries and organizations. With the ever increasing use of computers and the internet, there has been tremendous growth of cyber-attacks. The attackers target not only high end companies but also banks and government agencies. As a result the companies and governments across the globe are sparing huge amount of money to create a cyber-secure niche. In every organization, whenever an investment has to be made, everybody is concerned about the return which the organization will be getting from that investment. Every investment has to be justified from the point of view of return. Investments made in cyber security are never preferred by the organizations as they do not give any return. Return on Investments made in Cyber security is not measured in terms of profits and gains, but rather in terms of prevented losses. This paper provides an insight in to various established approaches which can be used for measurement of return on cyber security investment. Cost-benefit analysis of cyber security investments can be useful to the organization to have insight into whether money is well spent or not."

Stars matter: how FLOSS developers' reputation affects the attraction of new developers,Andreas Schilling,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2599991,"The attraction of new developers is a key challenge for initiatives developing Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS). While previous evaluations consider status gains and competence evaluations to be key drivers for novices' joining behavior, it is unclear how FLOSS developers' relationships with others affect the attraction of new developers. In this research, we look at FLOSS developers' relationships in terms of positive evaluations given by others. Using this perspective, we examine how FLOSS developers' reputation among members within and beyond the project community affects their projects' ability to attract new developers. We draw on Social Resource Theory (SRT) and hypothesize that developers with a high reputation among others enjoy high visibility and credibility, which in turn helps their projects to attract new members. Finally, we propose an evaluation approach for our research model that examines the reputation and project behavior of more than 1,000 FLOSS developers on a longitudinal base."
The influence of labelling and social exchange on group cohesion of IT-contract employees,Rajendra K. Bandi,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2599992,"Employee turnover in IT sector remains one of the most persistent challenges facing organizations. IT services organizations have been contracting their employees to support the global client requirements. There is an increasing trend in using IT contract employees in organizations, both at the service provider side and in the client organizations. With the increasing presence of contract employees, their interaction with employee co-workers could have impact on the group performance and turnover intentions. In this article, drawing on the categorization and labelling theories, we argue that the practices followed in client organizations to identify the contract employees by using distinct signifiers, such as different badging, Email ID prefixes, work location assigned to contract employees etc., will evoke a set of cognitions, which can have a negative influence on the group cohesion. We also propose that the quality of social exchange between the employee co-workers and contractors, and the quality of social exchange between the line manager and contract employee can attenuate the negative influence on group cohesiveness. The proposed conceptual framework is important in terms of understanding the relationship between contractors and employee co-workers from a managerial perspective."
The effect of job stress on job performance amongst IT professionals: the moderating role of proactive work behaviours,Tenace Kwaku Setor,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2599993,"The heavy dependence of modern businesses on information technologies and systems has expanded the job roles and increased the work demands and pressures of Information Technology practitioners. IT professionals who cannot cope with the ever increasing demands of their work experience high levels of occupational stress. Occupational stress has a negative income on work-related outcomes such as job performance. Extant research on stress-related studies have focused on passive or reactive strategies of coping. I propose a proactive approach by arguing that proactive work behaviours moderate negative relationship between job stress and job performance. I draw on Hobfoll's Conversation of Resources theory (1989) and the proactive coping literature (Aspinwall and Taylor, 1997) in the present proposal. A quantitative methodology is proposed for the study. Theoretical and practical contributions are discussed."
Technostressors and job stress: examining the role of personality traits,Shalini Chandra,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2599994,"In the current scenario of globally distributed working, information and communications technologies (ICTs) are playing a key role in connecting the global workforce. Further, rapid technological advances have made it possible to get connected anytime anywhere, thereby delivering data and information in real time to support businesses, organizations and personal decisions. Though the ubiquity of ICTs is beneficial for organizations, it often promotes negative outcomes for the employees such as -- increased work overload, increased stress, pressures due to excessive technology dependence and demands for enhanced productivity. Although prior research has examined the influence of technostressors on job stress, insights into the influence of personality traits on the perceptions of technostressors, and their consequent impacts on job stress, is rather limited. Such insights would enable a deeper understanding on the effects of individual differences on salient job related outcome. In this research-in-progress, by leveraging the differences in personality traits offered by the Five-Factor Model (FFM) and grounding the research in Transactional Model of Stress and Coping (TMSC), we theorize the moderating influence of personality on the relationships between technostressors and job stress. Specifically, the study theorizes the mechanisms through which each of the specific personality traits of - openness-to-experience, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and extraversion, interacts with technostressors to have a different influence on job stress. We plan to test the theorized model in a field study based on a survey of senior organizational managers, who regularly use information and communication technologies (ICTs) for professional tasks. Though technostressors are generally associated with negative job outcomes, we expect that for individuals with certain personality traits, the negative effect of technostressors may be mitigated. The study will thus contribute to the technostress literature -- specifically by incorporating the salient role of individual differences into the nomological network linking technostressors to job stress. The study will also provide insights to managers for paying special attention to allocating specific job roles to employees with particular personality traits for maximizing job related outcomes."
Factors affecting team performance in globally distributed setting,Ashay Saxena,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2599995,"Organizations are currently facing important and unprecedented challenges in an ever dynamic, constantly changing and complex environment. Groups of individuals working across time, space and organizational boundaries with links strengthened by webs of communication technology, commonly referred to as virtual team, have become a 'norm' in order to cater to the needs of global market places. Thus, it becomes essential to understand those factors that impact some of the key team related measures like efficiency, effectiveness and productivity of this evolved team setting. This paper presents a conceptual model and develops testable propositions highlighting factors that affect team performance in globally distributed setting. The research focus of this paper is on the impact of diversity, distributedness and task characteristics on team performance in distributed settings. Analysis plan and directions for future research are also discussed in the paper."

Building educational capabilities through information technology in developing countries: it takes a village,Devinder Thapa,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2599999,"There is one aspect of globalization of IT work that appears only in fleeting glimpses in the mainstream IS literature and is sidelined in the discourse in general. If global IT work is painted mainly as outsourcing IT-infused work from developed countries to poorer countries (euphemistically referred to as ""low income countries""), shouldn't the development of capabilities in these very same less-developed countries be a vital cog? Simply put, if these countries do not have a capable workforce, IT work, or any other work for that matter, cannot be outsourced to these countries. The question then is how can capabilities be developed in developing countries? In this research-in-progress paper, we address this question by examining a case of an activist-led initiative in Nepal called ""Open Learning Exchange"" (OLE in short) that used the capabilities of ICTs to deliver quality education to remote mountainous regions of Nepal. We collected data through interviews and group sessions as well as observations and document analyses. We are currently analyzing the data at both the micro and macro levels. At the micro level, we are using models from the IS training literature to gain an understanding of how training concepts developed in the West can explain the success of the initiative. Then we move to the macro level by shifting our interpretive gaze to the concept of ""eco-system"" in order to understand the role of the society and the surroundings in the implementation of capability building initiatives in developing countries and sustaining them."
Learning in knowledge team: can passion in teams' activities help?,Kyung Young Lee,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2600000,"This study investigates the antecedents of individual learning under knowledge team environments, where team members work together for a limited time period, share knowledge informally and eventually create a knowledge outcome that is beneficial for an organization. Participating in a knowledge team provides individual members with a good opportunity to learn during a short period of time, since they work on novel and creative tasks. However, because knowledge team activities are often non-routine for each member, their attitudes toward and psychological involvement with their knowledge team activities vary among different individuals. In this study, we suggest that individual passion about knowledge team activities is an important psychological input for individual members' external knowledge sourcing, internal knowledge sharing, and helping behaviors, which eventually lead to improving an individual's learning outcomes through knowledge team activities. We hypothesize that individual passion about the activities in a knowledge team positively influences both 1) knowledge management (sourcing and sharing) behavior; and 2) the organizational citizenship behavior -- helping (OCB-helping) of individuals, and these behaviors, in turn, result in their learning outcomes. Also, members' perceived psychological safety within knowledge teams positively moderates the impact of members' passion on internal knowledge sharing and helping behavior on learning outcomes. The research model will be tested with survey data from the knowledge team participants. We conclude with potential contributions of this study for the academy and practice."
Knowledge management and consumerization of information technology: opportunities and challenges,Benyawarath Nithithanatchinnapat,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2600001,"The conduct of knowledge management (KM) is changing fundamentally due to consumerization of Information Technology. The consumerization of Information Technology (CoIT) is transforming the way knowledge workers conduct work and share knowledge and information. Therefore, knowledge management activities in an organization are no longer only supported by traditional Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) (such as DB, DSS, data warehouses, email), but are also enabled through new forms of ICTs commonly referred to as social software or Web 2.0 technologies. Although, the ubiquitous and pervasive nature of these new forms of ICTs are creating a flexible KM environment, these digitized workspaces are also creating challenges. This study examines the following research question, what opportunities and challenges do knowledge-intensive organizations face during the conduct of KM in a multiple platform technology environment? In this research in progress, the preliminary findings (emerging research themes and potential research questions) from our pilot test are presented. When the study is completed, the multiple and diverse perspectives from the practitioner and scholarly journals plus interviews with knowledge workers and providers will be compared and contrasted to posit a more complete research agenda and management implications."
"Cultural richness versus cultural large scale insights: culture, globalization, and it workers",Michelle L. Kaarst-Brown,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2600002,"The increasing globalization of business and of the Information Technology (IT) workforce has increased interest in cross-cultural issues associated with distributed software development, virtual teams, and cultural conflict or collaboration using information and communication technologies (ICT's) [6]. We continue to see a reliance on studies using quantitative methods that compare a limited number of cultural variables (such as Hofstede's 1984), often because of the challenges associated with richer interpretive or ethnographic studies. Ethnography is a traditional design approach when studying rich cultural issues, deeply rooted in anthropology and goals of rich, emic description, and understanding [1]. Unfortunately, in information systems (IS) research, there is a predominant emphasis on quantitative survey designs, sacrificing cultural richness for broader sampling of more limited variables. Our extended abstract proposes mixed method designs that incorporate both quantitative and qualitative methods as a viable, richer alternative to survey research of cultural studies. For purposes of our presentation at ACM SIGMIS-CPR, we are providing some preliminary arguments from our larger study where additional research is analyzed and compared. To illustrate our points, however, we briefly compare two IS cultural studies, one using comparative ethnography and one using a sequential, phased mixed method design. Our goal is not to discourage rich cultural ethnographies, but to provide a viable alternative approach that may enable more culture research in IS."
"Differences in approach to and output of innovation: study of ""established"" and ""new entrant"" small software businesses in India",K.G. Satheesh Kumar,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2600003,"This paper examines whether and how established or incumbent firms and new entrants differ in their approach to innovation and innovation output. Analyzing three streams of theory we argue that established firms base their approach to innovation strategy on their resources, capabilities, technologies, and existing markets, while new entrants approach innovation from emerging customer needs and new markets. We also view that established companies are more likely to produce innovation related to new technology, products, and processes, while new entrants are more likely to perform marketing or business model innovations. In-depth qualitative interviews with CEOs and CEO- level officials in a sample of small software businesses in India produce results that support the conclusions from theory. These results have implications for industry and policy makers and open up avenues for further research."
Impacts of globalization on Indian industry: case of financialization in it and non it sectors,Upasana Mishra,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2600004,"This paper endeavors to understand the aspect of financialization that exists in companies, and study the possibility of an increase in an organization's profitability due to accessibility of financial instruments and other investment decisions that can sustain the net margins to meet market expectations and falling operational revenues by the real sector. Our objective is to observe the financial and investment activities of different real sector companies and relate the impact of their existence over the organization's net profits. The study also attempts to seek a further understanding upon the question of its exposure towards IT Service Organizations. With Information Technology reigning as a paramount factor in the Indian Economic context, the question of how financialization applies to the comparison of IT sector vis-Ã -vis other sectors is the highlight of this paper. This study after an extensive review of literature considers the reported items of the financial statements of 56 companies and analyze the various Non-Operational Items as independent variables that impact the Profit after Tax component of the Income Statement. These variables include income from financial services, other income, interest income, R&D expenditure and workforce and IT service as a dummy variable. The analysis was performed using multiple regression technique. The study overwhelmingly supports significant impact of non-operating income on profit of the organization though there is no statistical difference across IT and non-IT sectors. However, one has to bear in mind the limitation and cross-sectional nature of data before generalizing these results."

Getting IT together: linking computing intervention camps with computing careers,Christina N. Outlay,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2600005,The dearth of women choosing computing careers has been identified as a national problem in the United States. Efforts have been made to combat this by educating girls at a young age about technology. Recent research demonstrates that exposure to technology is insufficient to change young girls' attitudes towards computing careers and that interventions must explicitly tie technology activities to careers. Faculty and staff of a Midwestern University modified a computing summer camp for middle school girls to include career specific programming. . The camp partnered with the Girls Educating Themselves about Information Technology (GET IT) program to garner interest among middle school girls in computing careers. This exploratory paper describes the impact of this summer camp on girls' interest in pursuing careers in computing.
The barriers facing women in the information technology profession: an exploratory investigation of ahuja's model,Deborah J. Armstrong,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2600006,"In 2002, Ahuja conducted an extensive literature review and proposed a model of the challenges and barriers facing women in the information technology (IT) profession [3]. Her goal was to develop a model that might be used to stop the exodus of women from IT. While Ahuja's model has been consistently cited in the IT workforce literature (citation count as of 1/30/2014 ~ 65 utilizing ISI Web of Science and ~ 230 utilizing Google Scholar), women are still leaving the IT profession at an alarming rate. Using Ahuja's model as the impetus, the current investigation asked women working in the IT department at a Fortune 500 company what unique workplace challenges and barriers they faced that had influenced their voluntary turnover decisions at two time periods. The insights from this exploratory study are applied to Ahuja's model to propose an updated model that may be used to further explore the challenges and barriers facing women, and ultimately perhaps increase the retention of women in the IT field. The proposed model may be used to re-energize the dialogue regarding creating a more diversified IT work environment."
Perceptions of malaysian female school children towards higher education in information technology,Ven Yu Sien,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2600007,"Malaysia, like many countries, faces a shortage of students enrolling in computing undergraduate programs. This paper investigates the impact of technology on female secondary school children's choice of studying information technology (IT) in higher education. Malaysian female secondary school students from various ethnicities participated in a proprietary survey conducted in various cities in both East and West Malaysia. Despite the lack of technological support provided by government funded schools in terms of functioning computers and access to computers, there is a strong and encouraging trend in the respondents' interests in wishing to learn more about IT and their intentions to study an IT-related undergraduate degree. The respondents' perceptions on careers in IT are largely positive -- unlike the generally held belief that there are not many available jobs in the industry, and IT is a male-dominated field, difficult and boring. This is the first known Malaysian study that focuses on the perceptions of female indigenous school students towards higher education and careers in IT."
Great expectations: what do children expect from their technology?,Jessica Korte,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2600008,"Children of the digital generation have expectations of technology that may or may not reflect the expectations of the adults around them. This paper explores the expectations of and attitudes towards technology of a group of young Deaf children while interacting with a computer game application. We found that the children expect seamless, intuitive behaviour from technology in part based on their existing experience with game platforms, mobile technology, and other computer games. In addition to high expectations of the technology, the children were highly adaptive to unfamiliar interfaces, tolerant of prototype deficiencies once they were familiar with the prototyping approach and could readily interact with new game elements. The challenge for developers is to create applications that harness the creativity of the digital generation and meet their high expectations. We suggest that involvement of children within the development approach will assist in meeting these goals."

Collaboration in the open-source arena: the webkit case,Jose Teixeira,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2600009,"In an era of software crisis, the move of firms towards distributed software development teams is being challenged by emerging collaboration issues. On this matter, the open-source phenomenon may shed some light, as successful cases on distributed collaboration in the open-source community have been recurrently reported. In this paper, we explore the collaboration networks in the WebKit open-source project, by mining WebKit's source-code version-control-system data with Social Network Analysis (SNA). Our approach allows us to observe how key events in the mobile-device industry have affected the WebKit collaboration network over time. With our findings, we show the explanation power from network visualizations capturing the collaborative dynamics of a high-networked software project over time; and highlight the power of the open-source fork concept as a nexus enabling both features of competition and collaboration. We also reveal the WebKit project as a valuable research site manifesting the novel notion of open-coopetition, where rival firms collaborate with competitors in the open-source community."

Such an instrument is presented, tested with interviewees and supported by links to a theoretical framework that is based on social cognitive theory."
Does teleworking negatively influence IT professionals?: an empirical analysis of IT personnel's telework-enabled stress,Christoph Weinert,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2600011,"Despite the wide dissemination and acceptance of teleworking in the IT industry, companies like Yahoo!, HP, or Best Buy have stopped their telework programs, which indicates that there might also be some negative side effects in this type of work. In regard to this, our research focuses on one particular negative side of teleworking by focusing on teleworking-induced stress of IT professionals. We theorize that teleworking-induced stressors influence IT personnel's psychological and behavioral strain in the form of exhaustion due to teleworking and discontinuous intention towards teleworking. Results of an empirical online survey with 57 IT professionals validate these dependencies, which gives us the grounds to identify work overload, work-home conflict, information underload, and social isolation as influence factors of exhaustion due to teleworking. Further results reveal that discontinuous intentions towards teleworking is directly influenced by social isolation and exhaustion due to teleworking, whereas the influence of work overload is mediated by exhaustion due to teleworking. Work overload due to telework has the strongest effect on exhaustion due to teleworking, which in turn is the strongest influence factor on the discontinuous intention towards teleworking."
The relationship of personality models and development tasks in software engineering,Manuel Wiesche,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2600012,"Understanding the personality of software developers has been an ongoing topic in software engineering research. Software engineering researchers applied different theoretical models to understand software developers' personalities to better predict software developers' performance, orchestrate more effective and motivated teams, and identify the person that fits a certain job best. However, empirical results were found as contradicting, challenging validity, and missing guidance for IT personnel selection. In this research, we explore the current body of knowledge on software developers' personalities by conducting a structured literature review. We provide an overview of the applied psychological models, research designs, contexts, and results. We discuss our findings and suggest promising avenues for further research on software engineering task characteristics and the impact of personality-task fit on software development performance."
Systems thinking during systems analysis and design,Thomas W. Ferratt,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2600013,"A number of academicians and practitioners have called for more systems thinking. In this subjective essay I examine elements of systems thinking that are and are not likely to be taught in the education of systems analysts. My purpose is to understand the elements of systems thinking that potential systems analysts learn. Since no definitive model of systems thinking exists, I first summarize the elements of systems thinking in five alternative models of systems thinking extant in the literature -- general systems approach and complexity theory, cybernetics, system dynamics, soft system methodology, and critical systems theory and multimethodology -- and then examine which of those elements are included in Systems Analysis and Design textbooks. The findings indicate that what is likely to be taught is an approach to understanding and designing an information system that decomposes the system into component parts that interrelate through processing input data into outputs. This reductionist approach also includes an understanding of the information system's boundary, which determines system scope. What is unlikely to be taught, besides the five alternative models of systems thinking, are the general system concepts of synergism, negative entropy, dynamic equilibrium, internal elaboration, multiple goal-seeking, and equifinality of open systems. With this foundation I encourage IS faculty to engage in a continuing dialog on what elements of systems thinking potential systems analysts should learn."

The four 'W's of face-to-face: suggesting an enriched perspective on nearshoring relationship management,Alexander von Stetten,"May 2014,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2599990.2600015,"Outsourcing relationships usually benefit from face-to-face (F2F) meetings between client and vendor staff in various manners, for instance, by fostering trust, mutual understanding, and knowledge transfer. While being an expensive and often not frequently used measure in IT offshoring to far-distant countries, frequent F2F meetings are especially attractive in nearshore settings where geographic distance is small; thus establishing distinctive F2F patterns becomes an important criterion for managing a healthy nearshore outsourcing relationship. This paper proposes four 'W's that help both research and practitioners to think about F2F meetings in a structured way and to develop F2F strategies for achieving an effective outsourcing relationship. These 'W's represent different dimensions of F2F in terms of participants ('Who'), location ('Where'), time ('When'), and motives for meeting F2F ('Why'). We apply the four 'W's in a descriptive case analysis of three nearshore IS outsourcing arrangements between Western European clients and Eastern European vendors. This analysis provides evidence for the applicability and value of using the four 'W's, which will support future research on inter-firm collaboration regarding the identification of effective F2F patterns."

Alternatively, social capital theory suggests that founders who have high social capital and who engage in social networking will be able to go alone. Others, however, claim that team building is crucial for startup success as to bringing complementary skills together."

We provide such a review of IS research on gender and IT spanning 20 years, following the guidelines for conducting a ?descriptive review? (King and He 2006). Focusing on IS journals and conferences, we identify over 190 papers in which the authors specifically mentioned one or more of a set of terms in their title, appendix or keywords (e.g., gender, sex, men, women, etc.). We identify the recurring authors in this research stream and we classify these authors? research methods, types of respondents studied, authors? epistemological stance and their gender theory-in-use. We identify four topic areas and, for each, we provide descriptive summaries of corresponding papers: IT ethics; IT careers and education; IT adoption and use; attitudes to telework. Many papers we located neglect to specify a clear theory-in-use regarding gender (i.e., whether the authors believe that observed differences between men and women are socially constructed, due to biological factors, or the result of other influences). We found few studies that regard men, who account for a majority of IT employees, as gendered or consider gender a relevant issue when studying male employees, teleworkers, or computer users. Authors of most papers seem to assume that the presence of women is necessary to trigger gender as an issue."

Using social software for enhancing IS talents' e-learning motivation,Thomas Wirtky,"May 2013,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2487294.2487307,"In the aftermath of the global economic recession, 34% of all companies struggle to fill open positions. IS talents are the top-5 employees in demand. The countries' education systems are not flexible enough to provide enough workers with the right skills at the right point in time. E-learning could be part of the solution, if it were realizing its potential. The facts indicate that success of e-learning in the academic context is considerable, but users are not enough motivated to participate in corporate e-learning inhibiting life-long learning. Given the advent of social software and its potential to increase user motivation, this paper specifically develops a model predicting the impact of social software features on user motivation to participate in corporate asynchronous e-learning activities. Providing guidance for future e-learning research and implementations, it bases its findings on broad literature reviews."
Motivating students to acquire mainframe skills,Brandon Kyle Phillips,"May 2013,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2487294.2487308,"There has been a perception in both industry and in academia that mainframe skills are obsolete. As a result, there has been a decline in curricula addressing these skills. However, recent evidence shows that many organizations are still actively supporting mainframe technologies and report a need for students graduating in information technology to be trained in those skills, especially as much of their current mainframe workforce moves toward retirement. This paper examines the question of what motivates students to acquire mainframe skills. To do so, this research is investigates IBM's Master the Mainframe contest, a competition that attempts to engender enthusiasm for acquiring mainframe skills and ensure an adequate supply of such skills to organizations relying on them."

An investigation of the impact of recertification requirements on recertification decisions,Tanya McGill,"May 2013,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2487294.2487310,"Certification has become a popular adjunct to traditional means of acquiring information and communication technology (ICT) knowledge and skills and many employers specify a preference for those holding certifications. Many ICT certifications include a requirement to recertify regularly, but little is known about the impacts of recertification requirements on the intention to maintain certification. This research explores the factors that influence the recertification decision. The perspectives of both ICT students and ICT professionals were sought. Both students and ICT professionals were very positive about the benefits of certification and highlighted that intrinsic desire for improved knowledge and skill, as well as job related benefits, motivated them to obtain certification and maintain it. The ICT professionals also emphasized the importance of certification to their employers. ICT professionals had strong knowledge of the recertification requirements for the certifications they held. This was not, however, the case for the ICT students; many students had little knowledge of what recertification might entail. A key factor contributing to intention to recertify was flexibility to seek higher paying jobs. The cost of recertification was not found to be a major issue. Support from employers in providing time for obtaining recertification was considered important. Given the huge range of different certifications available, and the varying value of these to the holder at different points in their career, ICT professionals appeared to take a strategic approach to the decision to recertify. Not surprisingly, they considered, and selectively chose, those which are worth recertifying given their current position and career aspirations."
Identifying skills for entry-level IT consultants,Diane Lending,"May 2013,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2487294.2487311,"In this paper, we present preliminary research into the skills that entry-level IT Consultants need. Our data sources are senior-level IT consultants from six different companies and senior IS students who had just completed an IT consulting class where they were mentored by 12 different consulting firms. We used focus groups and open-ended surveys to get rich detailed data and then analyzed the results. Based upon this, we expand the identified skills for an entry-level IT Consultant to include being able to cope with changes, taking a holistic view of a problem, knowing when to ask for help, being a self-starter and having good time management skills. We found that both written and oral communication skills were important and that senior consultants looked for entry level personnel who were well-rounded."

At the same time, there is a growing body of work that suggests service-learning initiatives benefit all students, particularly women and minority students, in terms of stronger skill preparation and sense of collective belonging. The objective of this paper is to describe a six-week summer service-learning program aimed at addressing the under representation of African American students in the IT field. We found that the students experienced two significant outcomes: exposure to the skills necessary to enter the IT profession (e.g., project management, technical, and teamwork abilities); and participation in professional development opportunities that fostered a sense of belonging in the field."
Research in progress / teaching systems analysis and design: what do students really need to know?,Anne Powell,"May 2013,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2487294.2487314,"This research in progress describes a survey instrument and includes preliminary analysis results of responses from IS/IT professionals regarding Systems Analysis and Design (SA&D) course content and coverage. Questions focus on the skills, tools, development practices, and development methodologies considered most important for a new employee to know and have in their tool kit. We consider our findings in light of the IS 2010 Curriculum Guidelines, with an eye toward how our information can assist in course and curriculum design. We present preliminary results with next steps."

Behavior and expectations of mobile job seekers: an industry study focusing on job boards,Stephan BÃ¶hm,"May 2013,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2487294.2487316,"The market share of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets is growing rapidly. These devices are increasingly used to access the services offered on the Internet. Time spent online has started to shift considerably from desktop and laptop computers to mobile connected post-pc devices. In certain areas, mobile usage has already exceeded the access and traffic generated by desktop computers. This development also affects the usage behavior and ex-pectations of job seekers when accessing job ads and other job-related information online. In this context the paper at hand presents a study analyzing the behavior and user expectations of job seekers using mobile devices in Germany. The study shows that the majority of smartphone and tablet users have already accessed job ads and used job search applications (""apps"") through these devices. Moreover, many of those respondents who have already accessed job ads with a post-pc device also expect to be able to apply for a job via smartphone and tablet."
Research-in-progress: economic elements of collective memory in it occupational culture,Tim Jacks,"May 2013,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2487294.2487317,"With a backdrop of economic turmoil in recent history composed of a severe recession and slow recovery, there is timely motivation to explain the important role that collective memory plays in occupational culture. Based on the lens of cultural sociology and Halbwach's theory of collective memory, the findings uncover the heroes and origin stories that form the collective memory of the IT occupation in order to answer the research question ""What are the important elements of collective memory in IT occupational culture?"" The findings include elements of economic downturns, layoffs, outsourcing, job-hopping, 9/11, Silicon Valley, and increased regulation, as well as common heroes and origins. A hermeneutic interpretation is offered to further explain the importance of the results for both theory and practice."

Getting work done: evaluating the potential of crowdsourcing as a model for business process outsourcing service delivery,Lee B. Erickson,"May 2013,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2487294.2487323,"Crowdsourcing is the use of large groups of individuals to perform tasks traditionally performed by employees or designated agents. For business process outsourcing (BPO) service providers, the crowd may represent a new way to reduce costs and increase efficiencies associated with labor-intensive services. The ability to connect with the crowd to get work done may also open up new possibilities for workers in rural or economically depressed areas, and those within emerging markets. It is unclear, however, what challenges a crowdsourced services business model creates for organizations. An exploratory case study examining the potential of the crowd as a source of on-demand labor for delivering labor-intensive BPO services reveals the key role of information technology in overcoming economic, technical, and social challenges. Five key challenges were identified and are discussed: 1) protecting sensitive data, 2) ensuring quality of work, 3) ensuring timely completion of tasks, 4) managing increased workload, and 5) ensuring the sustainability of the model."

The meaning of IT work,Guorong Lim,"May 2013,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2487294.2487325,"Research has consistently highlighted the importance of meaning of work. Yet, the meaning of IT work remains unexamined in the IT literature. This study fills this gap by reporting on a study that aims to identify themes describing the meaning of IT work. This study adopts a qualitative grounded approach to identify a set of fifteen (15) themes that represent three types of meanings of work, i.e. Self, Others and Context. A large-scale field study was conducted to validate the meanings of IT work. The results of the field study indicate that the 15 themes identified have face validity. Self-related themes were selected more by IT professionals as describing the meaning of IT work compared to Others or Context. The top four themes describing the meaning of IT work concerned the opportunity to learn and develop oneself; deriving a sense of achievement from work; leveraging knowledge and skills; and creating something of value through work that impacts the company and its clients. We conclude this study with implications for research and the practice of IT."

An online recommendation system for e-commerce based on apache mahout framework,Sachin Gulabrao Walunj,"May 2013,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2487294.2487328,"Selecting a foundational platform is an important step in developing recommender systems for personal, research, or commercial purposes. This can be done in many different ways the platform may be developed from the ground up, an existing recommender engine may be contracted (OracleAS Personalization), code libraries can be adapted, or a platform may be selected and tailored to suit (LensKit, MymediaLite, Apache Mahout, etc.). In some cases, a combination of these approaches will be employed. For E-commerce projects, and particularly in the E-commerce website t, the ideal situation is to find an open-source platform with many active contributors that provides a rich and varied set of recommender system functions that meets all or most of the baseline development requirements. Short of finding this ideal solution, some minor customization to an already existing system may be the best approach to meet the specific development requirements. Various libraries have been released to support the development of recommender systems for some time, but it is only relatively recently that larger scale, open-source platforms have become readily available. In the context of such platforms, evaluation tools are important both to verify and validate baseline platform functionality, as well as to provide support for testing new techniques and approaches developed on top of the platform. Apache Mahout as an enabling platform for research and have faced both of these issues in employing it as part of work in collaborative filtering recommenders."
Team leaders' perceptions in the renewing of software production process,Pasi P. Virtanen,"May 2013,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2487294.2487329,"A contemporary software company is often based on mergers and acquisitions resulting in a number of organizational cultures and ways of working within the mother company. The inconsistencies between teams cause friction and ineffectiveness adding to the need of improve one's competitiveness in the ever toughening competitive situation. The streamlining of the operation is often felt the strongest on the operative level. The aim of this paper is to identify the roles and functions of team leaders in implementing a procedural change in software producing business enterprise. The study offers some solutions to the challenges that team leaders face when implementing change in their teams. Here change means new ways of working, including a change of used programming language. This study is a qualitative case study of a large software company that is renewing its software development processes towards component-based-software-engineering (CBSE). The research observes the phenomenon from a software engineering management point of view, and thus combines management with leadership issues."
"Together but apart: how spatial, temporal and cultural distances affect FLOSS developers' project retention",Andreas Schilling,"May 2013,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2487294.2487330,"Companies rely more and more on virtual teams which consist of globally dispersed members. Unfortunately, members' separation can raise considerable interpersonal challenges. In order to prevent conflicts from deescalating and ensure effective teamwork, companies pay careful attention to the management of members' spatial, temporal and cultural distances. While initiatives developing Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) similarly combine a worldwide distributed workforce, relatively little is known about how members' separation affects their collaboration. However, without such an understanding no adequate advice can be derived for managers of FLOSS initiatives on how to foster members' collaboration and retention. Building on lessons learned from the organizational domain this research hypothesizes that spatial, temporal and cultural distances are key factors for FLOSS developers' team integration and project retention. To evaluate our research hypotheses, we study FLOSS developers' contribution and conversation behavior and extract objective figures on their spatial, temporal and cultural distances to each other."
Determinants of success in crowdsourcing software development,Hamed Tajedin,"May 2013,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2487294.2487332,"With the advent of digitization, recent years have witnessed a surge toward collective undertaking of production process different from traditional ways of organizing. In this vein, crowdsourcing has lent itself into a successful emerging mode of organizing and firms are increasingly using it in their value creation activities. However, despite popularity in practice, crowdsourcing has received little attention from IS scholars. Specifically, what the determinants of success in this model are remains an unexplored area of research that we strive to address in this paper. We focus on software development via crowdsourcing and drawing on studies from IS success, OSS and software development, we build a model of success that has three determinants: the characteristics of the project, the composition of the crowd and the relationship among key players. Finally, we describe our research methodology and conclude with potential contributions of our work."
Applying the job demand-resource theoretical framework to better understand the stress inducing and reducing aspects of IT in jobs,Jignya M. Patel,"May 2013,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2487294.2487333,"While past literature in information systems (IS) has noted the stress inducing effect of information technology (IT) on employee well-being, little research has focused on the stress reducing potential of IT. This paper is the first in IS to makes use of the Job Demand-Resource theoretical framework to examine the concurrent stress inducing and stress reducing impact of IT on employee's work exhaustion, job satisfaction and turnover intention. In particular, we hypothesize that stress induced due to having to learn IT and being monitored by IT can cause work exhaustion while informational, communicational and usability support available by IT can cause job satisfaction. We further hypothesize that IT's stress reducing potential moderates the effect of general job demands on work exhaustion. The research can help managers identify the source of employee turnover and the appropriate interventions needed to reduce turnover when IT is introduced into a job."
Improving e-learning motivation using social software,Thomas Wirtky,"May 2013,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2487294.2487334,"Trained personnel are crucial for success in a knowledge society. Unsurprisingly, e-learning is expected to provide more than operational efficiency in organizations, which it did in the academic context, but did not in the corporate context. This research proposal argues that human motivation is the key difference between the two contexts. Social software seems to positively impact motivation, but how and which social software features to implement in a corporate e-learning context is still unknown. Hence, this research hypothesizes and analyzes the impact of social software features on user motivation to participate. It develops a model explaining why social software impacts motivation and ultimately uses experiments embedded in a design science approach to explain how and which social software features to implement in a given context. This proposal details this approach and provides intermediate findings in the quest for personnel motivation and corporate e-learning success."
Psychological contract in the information systems profession,RenÃ© Moquin,"May 2013,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2487294.2487335,"The past decade has ushered in challenging events for the IS profession such as economic instabilities, outsourcing/offshoring IS projects, and cloud computing. These eventualities present a stressful environment for emerging and tenured IS professionals. Firms are typically pressured to reduce costs by reducing IS staff only to revisit rehiring the same IS professionals. We investigated the phenomenon of IS professional career commitment to the IS profession using psychological contract theory (PCT) and affective events theory (AET). We present a model that examines the psychological contract in the IS profession (PCP), psychological contract breach in the profession (PCBP) and psychological contract violation in the profession (PCVP). We interviewed twenty-six IS professionals having experienced negative attributions in the IS profession where they reassessed their commitment to the profession (turnover intention) or left the field (turnover). Our results show that all interviewees remained in the field, suggesting the amount of negative conditions in the IS profession may be less significant to turnover. A deeper analysis of the qualitative data indicates that certain elements contribute to interest and commitment to the IS profession such as positive learning opportunities, challenges, and flexibility, such as profession specificity (programmer, CIO, analyst, and database administration). The vastness of the IS profession enables IS professionals to enter another capacity and still experience challenges and accomplishment. We present our implications of the results from a theoretical and practical position."

This study incorporated the methodology of previous studies, but added the evaluations of security technologies and tasks by the IT professionals, which contributes to the existing knowledge base of information security. Structural equation modeling was used to determine the strength of the relationships between Task-Technology Fit, perceived performance impacts, and utilization of security technologies.

(2006). The catalyst for this relook was the anomalies and incongruencies that surfaced when we tried to apply this framework in another study whose aim was to examine how hermeneutic reflection helps in learning. While the framework proved a useful vehicle to carry out hermeneutic analysis, it also proved inadequate in accounting for some significant aspects of what constitutes understanding of a system. A closer look at the data revealed that other theoretical premises could not only provide a better interpretation but also that these premises can potentially enhance the knowledge level framework. We are currently reinterpreting the data using three interpretive lenses, namely, practice lens, socio-materiality and genres. Our goal is to reconceptualize what constitutes understanding or knowledge of a system and propose a revised knowledge level framework."

Skills in the management oriented IS and enterprise system job markets,Chuck Litecky,"May 2012,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2214091.2214104,"With turmoil in the U.S. and world economies, it is more necessary than ever to ensure that graduates and employees have the skills necessary to compete in the job market. Some of the previous research on job skills has looked at job advertisements in print and online media to determine skills that employers were seeking; other research interviewed or surveyed employers to determine employers' needs. Results were often conflicting as previously summarized in Litecky, Zwieg and Huang. Now web content data mining techniques allow for much greater sampling and specific analysis of current MIS (simply defined as Management oriented Information Systems types of skills) oriented job ads. In this approach over two million advertisements were filtered to over one half million U.S. job advertisements for MIS degree graduates from various job websites. Management-oriented IS skills were compiled in a thesaurus and then those skills were extracted from the selected job ads. These skills were compared to the job advertisements for subsequent analysis. Results suggest much more concordance between disparate job advertisements and survey-based research. These results reinforce much of the desired uniqueness of MIS curricula as compared to other computing degree curricula. Results herein are limited to U.S. and are also contrasted with the similar content and analysis of job skills in the Australian IS job market. In addition an analysis is performed on the cross disciplinary data on Enterprise System/SAP jobs which were not limited to MIS graduates."

Following a Grounded Theory Methodological approach, we introduce the following concept: 'Shift of Understanding' (SoU). We develop this concept through the analysis of 57 interviews, completed by the analysis of over 200 famous quotes from authors/entrepreneurs. A SoU occurred after a shock, an entrepreneurial event or when a gradual evolution of a condition (e.g. accumulation of information or experience which at some point turns into knowledge) has come to its completion phase. In such cases, the inertia governing human behavior is interrupted and the individual perceives things under a new lens: a shift of understanding has just happened. A newly formed desire towards entrepreneurship, the realization of the urgency and immediacy of action, the reconsideration of both pragmatic and existential concerns such as the risk reduction, the capability to seize opportunities, or the meaning of life in general, the re-evaluation of one's prospects, propensities and needs are some of the manifestations of SoU which are found to be directly or indirectly linked to the actual IT entrepreneurial turnover behavior."
"Once you click 'done': Investigating the relationship between disengagement, exhaustion and turnover intentions among university IT professionals",Valerie F. Ford,"May 2012,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2214091.2214108,"Recent studies have shown that turnover is a major issue in IT environments (Armstrong & Riemenschneider, 2011; Carayon, Schoepke, Hoonakker, Haims, & Brunette, 2006; Moore, 2000a; Rigas, 2009). In fact, the research literature in IT and the popular press suggest that IT professionals are particularly vulnerable to burnout (Armstrong & Riemenschneider, 2011; Kalimo & Toppinen, 1995; McGee, 1996; Moore, 2000a). Using the Job Demands-Resources Model of Burnout as a framework, this study investigates the relationship between disengagement, work exhaustion and turnover intentions among IT professionals in a single university in a major metropolitan area. This study employed a non-experimental, cross-sectional survey research design using a Web-based survey questionnaire to collect data from a population (N=287) of university IT employees in a major metropolitan area. Two instruments were employed in the study: the OLdenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) measures work exhaustion and disengagement as developed by Demerouti et al. (2001); the Michigan Organizational Assessment Questionnaire Job Satisfaction Subscale (MOAQ-JSS) measures turnover intentions. The findings from this research indicated that disengagement consistently showed a statistically significant, positive correlation with turnover intentions. The most important conceptual implication of the study is that future investigations of disengagement, work exhaustion and turnover intentions among university IT employees must account for the unique work environment and how those workplace characteristics predict disengagement, work exhaustion and subsequent thoughts about quitting."

Work-life conflict and job mobility intentions,Damien Joseph,"May 2012,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2214091.2214110,"This study takes the first step in IT literature to examine the role of time-based and strain-based work-life conflicts on turnover and turnaway. Prior research on work-life (and work-family) conflicts and turnover typically examines it as a unidimensional construct. This study examines work-life conflict as a multidimensional construct comprising of time-based and strain-based conflicts. In this study, time and strain (i.e. demands on energy) are conceptualized as resources. The Conservation of Resources Theory is utilized to develop two sets of hypotheses relating time and strain to turnover and turnaway intentions. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of IT professionals drawn from a local IT professional association. The results indicate that time-based conflicts are not related to turnover and turnaway intentions. Strain-based conflicts, however, are positively related to turnover and turnaway intentions. This study concludes with a discussion of this pattern of results and presents subsequent research directions, which the authors are pursing."
Too much of and less than a good thing: implications for managing IT professionals,Thomas W. Ferratt,"May 2012,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2214091.2214111,"The management of information technology (IT) professionals is an important managerial concern. The way that IT organizations manage their IT professionals is essentially manifested in their implementation of human resource management (HRM) practices, such as those related to work environment and career development opportunities, social support, compensation, and employment security. This paper briefly introduces person-environment (P-E) fit theory to explore what an IT professional wants from an employment arrangement and what is supplied by the employer. However, a criticism of P-E fit theory is that it does not specify the form of the relationship between P-E fit and other constructs, such as satisfaction and job search. In order to address this gap, the paper investigates both equity theory and prospect theory as possible explanations. Ultimately, prospect theory is used to develop illustrative hypotheses. The paper then describes the methodology that will be used to test these hypotheses. The results of the tests, when completed, will be used to suggest directions for managing IT professionals and future IT HRM theory development and testing."
Train and retain: the impact of mentoring on the retention of FLOSS developers,Andreas Schilling,"May 2012,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2214091.2214112,"The acquisition of new knowledge is a critical task for software development. IT companies spend considerable resources in the training of their employees to succeed in a continuously changing industry. Depending on the voluntary commitment of their contributors, initiatives developing Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) identified members' learning and their retention as vital. Although contributors' knowledge building has been repeatedly found to facilitate their project continuance, FLOSS projects are lacking operational advices on how to assist their members' learning. Drawing on previous literature which emphasizes project members' social interactions and their practical experiences to build new knowledge, we propose mentoring as a training method for FLOSS projects. Based on organizational experiences, we propose a measure to evaluate mentoring as an appropriate strategy for FLOSS initiatives to facilitate individuals' learning and to retain their contributors on longitudinal base."
Evaluation of E-Technology acceptance: an empirical analysis,Rahmath Safeena,"May 2012,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2214091.2214114,"Different types of technology are emerging in the new era of computing especially the E-Technology and its adoption is considered to be an important issue among the consumers. E-technology has developed into an unavoidable technology among the internet consumers. E-Technology considered in this study includes Technology used for E-Commerce, E-Services and E-Business application. This study investigates the influence of Perceived Benefit (PB), Perceived Impediment (PI), and Social Influence (SI) on E-Technology adoption. Questionnaire survey is used for getting the data and empirical analysis is done. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 12 was used for computation. As expected, the results have supported the hypothesis that perceived benefit and social influence have positive effect on the use of E-Technology and perceived impediments have negative effect on the use of E-Technology. The results of the regression analysis conducted on the factors indicate that PB, PI and SI on E-Technology were found to be the most influential factors explaining the use of E-Technology services. The result shows that perceived impediment is negatively related to the adoption of E-Technology use which supports the hypothesis and is in line with the previous studies. The finding refers to the fact that consumers use E-Technology for the benefits and also due to its easiness in use which provides in comparison to other service delivery channels. Social Influence has positive effect on the use of E-Technology as the individuals think that using the advanced technology will improve his image and status in the society. Customers are not ready to take any risk on using the new system and hence impediments show negative significance. Any organization which adopts E-Technology for their day-to-day activities can show their conveniences in their promotional and advertising activities. Organizations also need to engage in security enhancement activities such as encryption, firewall, and user protection and authenticity. Trust is one of the more influential factors, implying that controlling the risk of online data is more important than providing benefits. This finding is particularly important for managers as they decide how to allocate resources to retain and expand their current customer base. However, building a risk-free online environment is much more difficult than providing benefits to customers. Therefore, companies need to search for risk-reducing strategies that might assist in inspiring high confidence in potential customers. The proposed model makes an important contribution to the emerging literature on e-commerce, especially with regard to E-Technology adoption. This study was conducted in a particular region and generalization of the result will have some shortcomings as with any other research. Hence, the replication of this study on a wider scale with more customers across geographical and cultural boundaries is essential for the further generalization of the findings. By using a longitudinal study in the future, we could investigate our research model in different time periods and make comparisons, thus providing more insight into the phenomenon of online banking adoption."
Breakthrough perpetual organization with IT governance,Sureerat Saetang,"May 2012,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2214091.2214115,"In corporate world with high competitive advantage, Information Technology (IT) performs as business foundation in organizations. IT Governance contains a variety of business tools and measures to operate IT structure and processes in supporting business strategy applicably. Taking a closer look in organizational IT structure and processes within organizations, workflow is essential to support automated business processes where documents, information, and tasks are progressed, together with, participants in different actions to accomplish business objectives by following business strategies and using IT systems. Moreover, workflow is considered as an integration of operational activity and active flow which drives as intra-organizational or private manoeuvre to achieve effective outcomes in complicated situations. Thus, workflow is one of the significant factors which support and accelerate business processes within organizations robustly and powerfully. This study employs a qualitative approach in regarding to IT governance implementation by interviewing executives management in senior and middle level with open-ended and closed-ended questions. Semi-structured interviews and survey questionnaires were selected to collect data of this research from Australian and Thai organizations which have implemented IT governance. At this stage, data analysis has not completed yet. However, the findings from this research will be disclosed further in the following publications. Moreover, this research encourages Information Systems researchers to consider IT governance in their research by giving its importance to industry and its worldwide suggestions."

Leveraging the crowd as a source of innovation: does crowdsourcing represent a new model for product and service innovation?,Lee B. Erickson,"May 2012,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2214091.2214117,"In today's fact-paced global marketplace, many organizations are turning to the ""crowd"" as a potential new source of innovation. However, little is known about the strategic use of crowd and how best to integrate them into internal processes. This paper presents preliminary findings from an ongoing grounded theory research study designed to identify trends and patterns associated with crowdsourcing by established organizations. Four common uses of the crowd are identified (i.e., productivity, innovation, knowledge capture, and marketing/branding). Further, key reoccurring themes related to task type, crowd knowledge, crowd location, and organizational goals, challenges, and value extraction are identified. Finally, a discussion of the emerging relationships between organizational goal, tasks to be completed, crowd characteristics, and the potential risks and benefits such initiatives create for organizations is provided."

Links to the source - a multidimensional view of social ties for the retention of FLOSS developers,Andreas Schilling,"May 2012,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2214091.2214119,"Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) is of vital importance for the daily life of many private and corporate users. However, the majority of all FLOSS initiatives fail, most commonly due to a lack of sustained developers. In contrast to previous research which used an individual centric or a structural perspective, this dissertation combines motivational and relational aspects to build a comprehensive understanding for FLOSS developers' ongoing project commitment. A unified research model is developed by drawing on established theories from organizational and sociological literature, in particular by combining Self-Determination-Theory (SDT) and Social-Identity-Theory (SIT). Both SDT and SIT have been found valuable concepts for staffing decisions in organizations. In addition to the development and evaluation of the research model, this dissertation derives operational strategies for project managers of FLOSS initiatives on how to enhance the retention behavior of their contributor base."
How employee turnover impacts social capital and performance of companies,Olav Spiegel,"May 2012,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2214091.2214120,"Recently, The Wall Street Journal proclaimed there is a ""War for Internet Talent"" among companies in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector. At the same time, talented employees often become entrepreneurial and establish their own startups. Thus, my research is motivated by these guiding questions: Which turnover patterns/trends can be observed in the ICT industry from a macro perspective (i.e., where does social and human capital flow)? To what extent can startup performance in this industry be explained by the social capital aggregated from the turnover history of its founders - that is, from the ties to former employers? Which employees are key resources in terms of their individual contributions to the aggregate social capital of their current employers? Do brokerage opportunities create turnover incentives for employees?"

Today, Internet usage is ubiquitous and the primary source of information for many people. This might also be one reason why the Internet has also established as the media of choice for personnel marketing and recruiting. However, with the growing popularity and use of the mobile Internet HR managers are facing new challenges in their personnel recruitment activities. These challenges as well as opportunities associated with the deployment of innovative mobile technologies for personnel recruiting are often discussed in connection with the concept of ""mobile recruiting"" -- but, what's behind it and does it really matter? To gain insights into the practitioners' awareness and assessment of mobile recruiting we conducted a survey among HR managers in Germany. The study was carried out first in 2009 and was repeated 2011. Key findings are presented in the paper at hand. The analysis shows that perceived relevance of mobile recruiting as well as its deployment increased at large."

It employs two complementary cross-cultural theories to develop an integrative model of culture and habitual system use in the context of knowledge management. More specifically, using the Theory of Basic Human Values and the Theory of IT-Culture Conflict, we posit that such cultural values as an emphasis on active mastery and change of the environment may, under certain conditions, lead to habitual knowledge management system use for knowledge sharing. In carefully selecting and integrating these two theories, this study overcomes major methodological problems inherent in much prior cross-cultural IS scholarship. We propose a quantitative methodology to test the model and discuss why structural equation modeling is the best-fitting data-analytic technique for quantitative cross-cultural IS research."

Exploring the role of mentoring in the IS profession: a cross-national comparison,Monica Adya,"May 2012,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2214091.2214130,"Workplace mentoring is beneficial to protÃ©gÃ©s, most often, in the form of career related and psychosocial support. Mentoring is found to positively impact career progression and satisfaction, is positively correlated with affective commitment, and negatively related to turnover behavior. For academics and practitioners concerned about more effective integration and participation of IS professionals in the IT workforce, mentoring may provide a solution for mitigating the effects of a high-pressure, masculine work environment. While mentoring has been examined to some extent in the general management literature, it has received only passing attention in information systems (IS) research, particularly in a global context. The unique characteristics and demands of the IS profession and increasing trends toward offshoring warrant an IS-specific examination of mentoring behaviors, preferences, and influences. In this study, we propose to conduct a cross-cultural study of mentoring among Indian and American IS professionals. Our study hopes to yield beneficial insights for mentoring practice and research in the IS profession."

Measuring alignment within relationships among socio-technical system components: a study of Wiki technology use,Andrea J. Hester,"May 2012,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2214091.2214132,"Wiki technology provides capabilities for collaborative knowledge management. Web 2.0 technologies such as wikis eliminate the boundaries of time and space, and support higher levels of social interaction. In order to achieve the highest return from information systems, organizations must match the capabilities of technology with their complex social environments. This research proposes examination of organizational information systems as socio-technical systems that involve interacting relationships among the main components of actors, structure, tasks and technology. Alignment within the relationships will facilitate increased system use; however, gaps in alignment may impede system use and result in poor performance or system failure. The pilot study presented here gives insight into how alignment can be measured by evaluating underlying factors affecting the relationships and subsequent system use."
Organizational uses of the crowd: developing a framework for the study of crowdsourcing,Lee B.

Currently, organizations are turning to the crowd to complete a wide variety of organization tasks. However, we know little about the types of tasks completed, the different crowds that participate, and the characteristics that manifest themselves in these initiatives. Preliminary findings from a grounded theory study designed to identify patterns and themes found in crowdsourced initiatives have revealed four common uses of the crowd (i.e., productivity, innovation, knowledge capture, and marketing/branding). Additionally, reoccurring themes related to the knowledge the crowd brings to the task, the location of the crowd, as well as organizational challenges and value capture have been identified. Emerging patterns and relationships among the four identified uses and these reoccurring themes are discussed."
Creativity in Dyads: the role of closeness and media multiplexity,Xiqing Sha,"May 2012,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2214091.2214134,"Identifying the features of social ties that facilitate the generation of creative ideas deepens the understanding of relational factors in dyadic communication that trigger creative thinking. Tie strength, which is the key factor that shape creativity, has ambiguous effects on shaping creativity. Specifically, strong ties have both positive and negative effects on creativity when it is examined from a structural perspective and social perspective. It is also unclear that through what kind of mechanisms behind that trigger strong ties have an opposite association with creativity. Therefore this study distinguishes different tie types of tie strength and investigates how they have opposite effects on creativity. Furthermore, this study also examines whether the usage of multiple media in dyadic communication would influence the interaction. Our finding shows that dyads that are strongly connected by multiple ties (i.e., professional ties, personal ties) are less likely to share diverse expertise but more likely to obtain thoughtful responses from each other. Compared to dyads using a single communication media, dyads that use multiple communication media are less likely to share diverse expertise due to communication cost and redundant information exchanged. However the dyads are more likely to respond to each other with thoughtful answers when they use multiple communication media. These findings provide both theoretical contribution to extant literature and practical implications."

Schema accuracy and career challenges for men in the information technology workplace,Deborah J. Armstrong,"May 2012,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2214091.2214136,"Much of the diversity literature in the IT field has focused on the perspectives of women and racioethnic minorities. We expand this exploration by looking at perceptions of the unique challenges and barriers to advancement facing men in the IT workplace utilizing a cognitive lens and schema accuracy theory. In addition to evoking the unique challenges men perceive they face different from women, we also collected data from women regarding their perceptions of men's unique challenges. We found a minimal level of shared understanding occurring around interactions between the sexes (i.e., cross-gender interaction). These findings advance our understanding of the cognitive overlap (and lack thereof) regarding the perceptions of the unique challenges and barriers facing men in the IT field, and provide an initial step toward developing a shared understanding of the IT work environment."
Analyzing citation impact of IS research by women and men: do women have higher levels of research impact?,Mike J. Gallivan,"May 2012,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2214091.2214137,"Over the past decade, the SIG MIS conference has become a leading venue for research on gender issues in the IT workforce. The question of women's research impact relative to men is important for several reasons. First, if research by women is not cited as often as that of men, it would be necessary to ask why. In that case, the explanation may be due to the fact that women publish their work in venues that are less visible relative to men; because women publish on topics that draw less interest from a broad audience (resulting in fewer subsequent studies that cite their work); or that women's research, as a whole, is of lower quality than that of men. Conversely, if research by women IS scholars is cited more often than research by men, it is again worth asking why: is it because women (as a whole) publish in more visible, higher-quality venues than men, because women publish on topics that interest a broader audience, because their research addresses more timely or controversial topics, or their research is of higher quality, relative to men? We test various hypotheses to show that papers published by women in five leading IS journals are cited more frequently than papers by men, after controlling for the journal and the subject matter of the papers. The effect is small, but significant. We conclude that this is because (a) women publish in MIS Quarterly at a higher rate relative to men -- which happens to be the IS journal that receives the most citations; (b) women are under-represented among authors in three journals that receive fewer citations; and (c) women generally publish few papers on topics that receive the lowest rates of citations."
Exploring gender and job embeddedness in information technology professionals,Sherry D. Ryan,"May 2012,",https://doi.org/10.1145/2214091.2214138,"Despite the current difficulties in the economy, the demand for information technology (IT) workers is expected to grow substantially in the next several years. The need for talented IT workers is exacerbated by the looming retirement of many IT professionals. Thus, it is becoming increasingly important for organizations to find ways to retain their valuable and skilled IT employees. One construct that has been introduced to assess reasons employees choose to stay in their current position is job embeddedness. This paper explores the effect of gender on the three dimensions of job embeddedness: an employee's fit with the organization, the potential sacrifice they would make if they left their job, and links or connections they have to others in their organization. This research-in-progress paper hypothesizes that there are differences between males and females in in each of the embeddedness dimensions."

Focusing on gender or ethnicity, alone, is insufficient to explain the under representation of women and minorities in IT careers. Rather, we believe that stratifying the population in a more nuanced manner, such as by gender within ethnic group, provides deeper insights into the phenomenon of under representation. Hence, this research approaches the topic of gender and the IT profession from the perspective of intersectionality of gender and ethnicity. Within-gender analysis reveals variation in gender stereotyping by gender-ethnic group. White females and minority males (i.e. Black and Hispanic males) exhibited the most masculine stereotyping of IT skills. In contrast, White males and minority females (i.e. Black and Hispanic females) exhibited the fewest. Three themes emerge from this research. First, the skills that will be increasingly important in the future in distinguishing equivalently credentialed IT professionals were not absorbed into the ""masculine"" category. Second, hegemonic masculine traits appear to be deeply entrenched in the next generation of IT professionals. Third, when peering more deeply into the gender stereotyping of skills by respondent demographics, what emerges is a pattern that emphasizes the critical role of intersectionality in gender analyses of the IT profession."

Among other factors, successful return on IT investments depends upon timely availability of quality of IT personnel. IT workforce planning necessitates active projections of a firm's workforce transformation from both known technology evolutions such as shifting among platforms, and personnel transition scenarios such as retirement, turnover, and other career decisions. Using a design science approach, we propose the development of a modular workforce planning system that captures current workforce inventory, projected personnel transitions, and projected skill evolutions to generate future workforce states. This proposed system has implications for development and design of systems for succession, transition, training, and hiring/exit decisions for an IT workforce environment."

In this research in progress study, we identify some problems that have been identified in the organizational behavior literature. We review various research streams that employ difference scores, focusing in depth on one popular stream of 'difference score' research: work on person-environment fit or person-job fit in shaping IT employees' job satisfaction, performance and turnover intentions. We analyze a dataset containing difference score data for 120 software developers with regard to their preferences for specific job attributes, along with their self-reports regarding how well their current job matches these preferences. We analyze our data using both conventional difference score methods, as well as using new techniques suggested in the OB and IS literature."

While research has examined factors contributing to the declining of IT enrollments, it is unclear why some IT students choose to go on to an IT career while others eschew IT. To address this gap, this paper examines students' commitment to the IT profession as students' attitudes towards the profession begin to form. We draw on and extend the social cognitive career theory (SCCT) by examining factors that affect IT students' occupational commitment. We tested our model using survey data from a large sample of students majoring in computer science and information systems related fields. Results from structural equations modeling indicated that students with higher interests, self-efficacy, outcome expectations and social support report higher occupational commitment. This study contributes to theory by extending prior research on occupational commitment by providing insights into factors that shape occupational commitment prior to entering the IT workforce."

However, the global economic development has changed on the one side the challenges of organizations [22], and on the other side also the perception of job-related factors of IT talent [17]. Based on this development we compare major IT turnover constructs using three empirical surveys in 2008, 2009 and 2010 in order to discuss how the global economic development influences the perceptions of job-related factors and turnover intentions of German IT personnel. The analysis showed that job satisfaction and organizational commitment is decreasing since 2008, perceived job alternatives are increasing compared to 2009 and turnover intention has reached a maximum in 2010 compared to the two other years in question."

Exponential random graph modeling of communication networks to understand organizational crisis,Jafar Hamra,"May 2011,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1982143.1982163,"In recent social network studies, exponential random graph models have been used comprehensively to model global social network structure as a function of their local features. In this study, we describe the exponential random graph models and demonstrate its use in modeling the changing communication network structure at Enron Corporation during the period of its disintegration. We illustrate the modeling on communication networks and provide a new way of classifying networks and their performance based on the occurrence of their local features. Among several micro-level structures of exponential random graph models, we found significant variation in the appearance of A2P (Alternating k-two-paths) network structure in the communication network during crisis period and non-crisis period. This finding could also be used in analyzing communication networks of dynamic project groups and their adaptation process during crisis which could lead to an improved understanding how communications network evolve and adapt during crisis."
Conceptual aspects of IT governance in enterprise environment,Sureerat Saetang,"May 2011,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1982143.1982164,"In today's business environment there are various regulations, concepts and strategies of business development that focus on how technology can support business effectively. From among these concerns, IT governance has drawn attention from corporate broads to senior management. As a result, a number of IT governance frameworks have emerged with each having its own strengths and weaknesses. These frameworks, on one hand provide multidimensional benefits to organizations to develop higher interests like competitiveness, efficiency of It infrastructure, and IT related; and on the other hand these frameworks also align IT infrastructure with strategic business agenda. Since these frameworks owe their existence to different areas of IT application, their success is also quite varied. This research is motivated by the same question, i.e. to examine what makes an IT governance frameworks work. It follows a qualitative interpretive research methodology with a case study approach. This research significantly contributes towards building theoretical base for the key issues and success factors of successful IT governance implementation processes. It also provides guidelines to executive managers about IT governance framework adoption, customization, and implementation."
The IT professional as stakeholder,Norah Power,"May 2011,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1982143.1982167,"The concept of stakeholder is well established in the field of IS, yet the IT person's role as a stakeholder is often ignored because stakeholders on the customer side are, appropriately, regarded as more important than stakeholders on the supplier side. Focusing on various IT stakeholders can give us a fresh perspective on many issues of concern. Tools and techniques for stakeholder analysis, currently trained exclusively on customer-side stakeholders, can possibly lead to useful approaches for analyzing IT roles, including: understanding the skills and abilities needed to succeed in the IT profession, analyzing role profiles, supporting work satisfaction and staff retention, improving individual and team performance, facilitating group-work, particularly (globally) distributed teams. In particular, an analysis of stakeholder relationships can lead to a conceptual framework that will help researchers and educators to understand and communicate the ways IT professionals work with other categories of stakeholders in different development contexts."

Therefore, a psychological theory - which is named Five-Factor Theory of Personality - is applied to offer a theoretical framework for the interaction between personality and typical adoption theories or models (as TAM, UTAUT, etc.). The insights should help to gain insights of the impact of personality on IT usage, IT usage drivers and IT usage consequences in different IS research fields. The proposal focuses on IT (non-)usage behavior and IT diffusion, but should also offer valuable insights for IT management research as IT outsourcing decisions or how to handle employees."

To meet this recruiting challenge a research project on the potentials of new innovative ways of mobile personnel recruitment, ""ReMoMedia"" Recruiting in the Mobile Media"", was initialized at the University of RheinMain, Wiesbaden, Germany. The three-year project is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, and investigates the practicability and feasibility of applying mobile media as an additional channel for personnel recruiting in the HR marketing mix. Accompanying the practical implementation possibilities this dissertation project aims at providing a scientific approach to the topic. To offer some guide for the organizational challenge of attracting and recruiting qualified employees the study in hand will apply theory on information system (IS) success adapted to the mobile requirements and the recruiting context. Working up on the success factors of mobile IS as an additional channel for personnel recruiting the analysis of the appropriate target group as well as the target group's expectations towards these applications will be subject of the study."

Drawing on relevant literature, we identified a comprehensive list of services that should be provided by professional associations in order to prepare, recruit, and retain professionals. Then we assessed several computing professional associations to determine whether they offer those identified services. Our findings show that ACM has better coverage of services, followed by IEEE-CS, AITP, and AIS. This study indicates that computing professional associations have considerable influences on higher educational institutes by establishing curriculum guidelines to prepare professionals, on organizations by organizing career fairs and placement websites to recruit professionals, and on retention by providing professional development opportunities. We propose that more research is needed to gain an in-depth understanding of the role of computing professional associations and to identify unique ways they can influence preparation, recruitment, and retention of computing professionals."

The impact of media selection on stakeholder communication in agile global software development: a preliminary industrial case study,Biyagamage Agra Junius Fernando,"May 2011,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1982143.1982177,"This paper investigates the selection of appropriate communication media in agile global software development. Frequent communication between project stakeholders is core to agile software development. Furthermore the choice of media is fundamental to effective communication. In a global software development environment the challenges that distance creates must be addressed in the choice of media. The wrong media for the wrong task can cause many problems. We apply Media Synchronicity Theory to the selection of communication media in a global software company which uses Scrum. Our results show that the theory is helpful in highlighting the important factors in choosing an appropriate media for 'conveying' and 'converging' communications. However the theory does not cover all important factors. We confirm previous findings that media availability, media familiarity and infrastructure capabilities also need to be taken into consideration."

Boundary spanners and client vendor relationships in IT outsourcing: a social capital perspective,Madhuchhanda Das Aundhe,"May 2011,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1982143.1982179,"Information technology (IT) outsourcing is one of the key contexts in management in which inter-organizational relationships are studied. Since in an IT outsourcing situation, the client and vendor organizations come together with the stated purpose of creating something new within the dynamics of a business relationship, a social capital perspective of the client-vendor relationship is quite appropriate for the study of the inter-organizational relationship in IT outsourcing. The social capital perspective provides for an examination of the structural, cognitive, and relational aspects of the client-vendor relationship and its effect on the knowledge exchange and outcomes of IT outsourcing. Between the client and vendor organizations, boundary spanners function as exchange agents and are responsible for information exchange and knowledge creation. This study attempts to understand the role of these boundary spanners in creating social capital in client-vendor relationships in IT outsourcing. In this study, the behavioral exchange of the boundary spanner in an organization with their counterparts in the other organization is analyzed from a social capital perspective. Using a case study approach, the roles, the relationship, and the outcomes of IT outsourcing arrangements in ten organizations are being examined to identify the structural, cognitive, and relational aspects of their exchange with their counterparts."

Recruiting and retaining competent IT personnel has become a key managerial function. A number of studies (especially in the developed world) have focused on IT personnel issues such as career orientations, recruitment, and turnover. This study contributes to the literature on IT personnel turnover intentions from a developing country perspective. The results of the study indicate that majority of the IT personnel either intend to leave their jobs for another or uncertain about whether or not to leave their jobs. Job satisfaction and growth opportunities are key influences on turnover intention. Career satisfaction, supervisor support, organization commitment, length of service, and age did not contribute significantly to turnover intention."

The current investigation offers a replication and extension of the Riemenschneider et al. (2006) study. Specifically, this research begins to examine what changes have (or have not) taken place in the IS workplace regarding the challenges and barriers facing women in the IS field. Preliminary findings indicate that while Barriers: Promotion, Managing Family Responsibilities, Work Schedule Flexibility, Work Stress and Turnover were the key concepts identified by Riemenschneider et al. (2006), Work Stress is one of the few key issues that remains salient. What seems to be more salient for the current participants are issues related to the work environment, such as politics and bureaucracy (e.g., Barriers: Politics)."

Unfortunately, the supply of IT graduates, as measured through a sample of universities in the southeastern U.S suggest that the number of IT majors appears to have leveled off at level that will not meet the demand. This paper presents one organization's efforts at designing an innovative student internship program that will hopefully both entice students to major in IT, but also serve as the conduit to place these IT majors into IT positions. Social Cognitive Career Theory, a variant of Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory, is enlisted to help explain how such a program can serve both as a recruiting tool as well as a retention tool."
How IT project managers cope with stress,Derek Smith,"May 2010,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1796900.1796915,"This research examines the level of stress experienced by IT project managers and determines the types of coping strategies used to handle their stress. Sixty-four South African IT project managers completed an online questionnaire. The findings indicate that IT project managers are highly stressed and tend to utilize maladaptive coping strategies more as their stress levels increase. These strategies included self-distraction, venting, self-blame, positive reframing, behavioral disengagement, substance use and denial. This contradicts prior research where the coping strategy was emotional support. In addition, the more experienced the IT project managers were, the higher their levels of stress. These findings could assist project managers to better understand the effects of stress on their productivity and to consider more appropriate coping strategies to assist them to reduce their stress."

Our objective is to discover if team motivation is affected when developers and managers disagree on a project's outcome. We also investigate if culture influences team motivation. We collected questionnaire data on 290 completed projects from software engineering practitioners based in Australia, Chile, and USA. We asked if the respondent considered their project was successful and if higher level management considered the project a success. We found that more projects were perceived successful by management than by developers. Also, successful projects are associated with higher levels of team motivation than failed projects or projects with outcome disagreement. Culture makes a difference to levels of team motivation for both failed projects, and projects with outcome disagreement. An over-riding influence on team motivation is agreement with other stakeholders. To motivate practitioners, stakeholders need to agree on what constitutes a successful or a failed project before the start of the project."

The performance of cross-cultural teams may depend upon a number of factors, including cross-cultural differences and team processes. The purpose of this study is to determine which factors influence the successful performance of cross-cultural teams. The findings showed that team commitment, trust, and team processes played a more important role than cultural differences in the effectiveness of the global IT teams."

Turnover can be a crisis for all companies in any industry, especially for IT industry, because losing an employee can cause financial as well as non financial problems. This study examines the relationship between style of leadership; namely transformational and transactional leadership and turnover intention in IT Companies in Iran. The study was performed based on survey method using MLQ questionnaire according to Full Range Leadership Model. A number of current employees of respondent Companies (N=83) completed this questionnaire. Correlation analysis was done on the data gathered from questionnaire based on 95% of confidence. Findings of this study indicate that the transformational leadership has a significant relation in decreasing personnel turnover intention. Among the four factors of transformational leadership style, Individual consideration was proven to be the most important factor. The findings of this research could help Managers in IT Companies to choose the right leadership style in order to decrease the employees' turnover intention."

To provide a first understanding of those interfaces we present the results of expert interviews describing the development and role of boundary spanners in the corporate context. To arrive at a more detailed view of their abilities and characteristics we tested their skill profile using a skill set based on the EUCIP (European Certification of Informatics Professionals). We come up with 25 common skills of both participants important for the interface function between business and IT.

As IT companies in Germany survived the economic meltdown quite good, the question is how German IT personnel feel after a hard year filled of bad news about massive layoffs and less open positions. Therefore we compared the individual items of the major IT turnover constructs -- job satisfaction, organizational commitment, perceived alternatives and turnover intention -- for two groups of German IT personnel before (data gathered in May/June 2008) and after the bust of Lehman Brothers (June 2009). The results of our empirical analysis show that IT workers just changed their perception of job alternatives during the last twelve months. They reported a similar job satisfaction, organizational commitment and turnover intention in 2008 and in 2009."

The extant literature that has paid attention to processes have conceptualized these as structures and examined them through variance studies. In this paper, we address this knowledge gap by advancing hermeneutics as a lens to depict the process through which users come to learn about the system. We explain the hermeneutic process, situate it in a training context and illustrate our conceptualization by interpreting a specific training program at a large organization. Based on our findings, we argue that hermeneutics is an appropriate lens to view training and outline how a training program can be designed according to hermeneutic principles."
Do I matter?: the impact of individual differences on training process,Saurabh Gupta,"May 2010,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1796900.1796946,"The increasing investment in technology for training and learning in organizations underscores the fundamental importance for researchers to understand and investigate technology-mediated learning (TML). Currently, a great deal of Information Systems (IS) training for both IS professionals and end-users has a TML component. With the continuing growth of TML and advances in information technology, there will be a likely increate in TML-based IS training in the future. Advances in technology have created opportunities to deliver mass training as well as to personalize learning. To facilitate understanding in this area, this research analyzes the impact of individual differences on end-user training (EUT) in a TML environment. Using Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST), the learning process is modeled as the appropriation of a training method. Individual differences, or internal structures, are argued to have a significant direct effect on training outcomes and to impact the level of faithfulness of appropriation of learning/training method, thus, having an important indirect effect on learning outcomes. In this study, multiple individual differences were investigated in a laboratory experiment. Data was analyzed using SEM. The results of the study provide a vehicle for researchers, both in IS and Education, to better design and develop training methods and technology tools."

Workforce preparation and ABET assessment,Diane Lending,"May 2010,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1796900.1796955,"Accreditation is a means of evaluating and improving curriculum. ABET accreditation requires that IS programs assess whether students attain the programs' educational objectives after they graduate. One way to assess these objectives is to ask alumni how important these objectives were in their job success and how well their education prepared them for these objectives. In October 2009, a web survey was sent to recent IS graduates to ask them to rate how well they felt the IS program prepared them for their first and subsequent jobs. This paper analyzes the results and sees how the objectives align with the skills that these graduates felt they needed on their job. Graduates felt well prepared for implementing software and database solutions as well as technical presentation. The largest gaps in preparation were in management of projects, analysis of technical solutions, non-technical writing. The research serves two purposes: 1) to model a process for other IS programs seeking ABET accreditation; and 2) to provide evidence as to whether these objectives are perceived as providing an adequate base for preparing an IS workforce."

Application stewardship: a user responsibility approach to post-implementation application performance,Paul S. Licker,"May 2010,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1796900.1796959,"This paper makes the argument that an important mediating influence on the value of the usage of an information systems application is a set of activities called application stewardship. These activities, when performed effectively, tend to increase the value of applications in the hands of users and, when performed organization-wide, increase the orientation of the organization with respect to its usage of IT resources, including information itself, thereby reducing the gap between IT and its internal clients. The paper provides the rationale for extending application responsibility to the user side and lays out the definition of application stewardship and its relationship to delivering value in the hands of users. We develop a theoretical framework showing where stewardship activities enhance value in the hands of users, including a model of the forces tending to enhance or diminish stewardship effectiveness. The paper finishes by integrating the idea of application stewardship with the concept of organizational IT orientation."
Increasing collaborative knowledge management in your organization: characteristics of wiki technology and wiki users,Andrea J. Hester,"May 2010,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1796900.1796961,"This study examines characteristics of Wiki technology and wiki users in an effort to uncover factors facilitating increased adoption and usage of Wiki technology as a collaborative knowledge management tool. The current business environment is characterized by trends in mobility, virtualization and globalization. These trends call for more extensive interaction and collaboration both internal and external to organizations. The resulting changes have been met with an emerging trend of a new generation of Internet-based technologies described as Web 2.0. The umbrella of Web 2.0 technologies support a more collaborative business environment and span across time and distance. Web 2.0 advances have subsequently fostered new approaches to knowledge management with Wiki technology making way as an effective alternative to traditional knowledge management systems. Wiki technology features the unique characteristics of open editing and revision and history capabilities. When these features are combined with knowledge representation and maintenance features and harnessing of collective wisdom, Wiki technology may enable higher levels of collaboration facilitating more effective knowledge processes. Nonetheless, technology and processes are not the only components of a knowledge management system. This study focuses on the users of Wiki technology as another key element in effective utilization of a collaborative knowledge management system."
Tailoring software development,Thomas W. Ferratt,"May 2010,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1796900.1796963,"In this research-in-progress we review existing studies and theories that focus on tailoring software development. Our purpose is to develop a more complete model of the tailoring process than is found in the current literature. In our theory, ""tailoring"" refers to the activities of selecting a set of standardized processes for a software development project prior to the start of the project, modifying those selected processes for the specific project as the development team begins its work, and monitoring and adjusting the processes and project goals and constraints over the course of the project. We present a model that allows us to understand what is involved in tailoring software development at key points in time relative to a specific software development project. We present the model as currently a work-in-progress and illustrate its use by presenting a few hypotheses based on relationships specified in the model and supporting literature."

Value contribution of it in recruiting: a multi-national causal analysis,Andreas Eckhardt,"May 2009,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1542130.1542132,"Despite an era of global recession qualified staff is still rare due to the demographical situation worldwide. Companies are forced to develop new cost saving recruitment strategies to ensure the necessary labor supply while recruitment budgets are pruned. In this area, the use of information technology creates interesting opportunities to contact candidates and process applications, not only more economically but also more quickly. The actual value of the contribution made by IT in HR is nevertheless still disputed. For this reason, we conducted an empirical analysis in three different countries examining the impact of IT on process performance determinants in staff recruitment. With the aid of three causal models for Germany, Austria and Switzerland we could confirm a positive impact of IT use on time and costs per hire as well on the overall recruitment process quality."
Help to find the needle in a haystack: integrating recommender systems in an IT supported staff recruitment system,Sven Laumer,"May 2009,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1542130.1542133,"Despite the benefits of information technology for corporations in staff recruitment (reduced time and costs per hire) the increased use also led to glut of applications especially in major enterprises. Therefore the companies forced to find the best candidate in times of a ""War for Talent"" need help to find this needle in a haystack. This help could be provided by recommender systems predominately used in e-commerce to recommend products or services to customers purchasing specific products. Recommender systems could assist the recruiter to find the adequate candidate within the applicant's database. In order to support this search and selection process we conduct a design science approach to integrate recommender systems in a holistic e-recruiting architecture and therewith provide a complete and new solution for IT support in staff recruitment."

However, these systems' often lack social constructive learning features such as sharing, peer review, and group collaboration. This paper describes a new ePortfolio system that supports both personal and social constructive learning, and reports on its implementation and evaluation in a Management Information Systems course. Student surveys and interviews showed that students found the software easy to use and beneficial to learning and knowledge sharing. This paper also discusses design problems in current e-learning systems and reasons for promoting both personal and social constructive learning supports in e-learning systems."
Training students to be innovative information systems developers: synergizing project-based learning with problem-based learning,Wee-Kek Tan,"May 2009,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1542130.1542136,"The competitive nature of today's business environment has made it necessary for educators to inculcate in our students a sense of innovativeness in Information Systems (IS) development. While working on real-world projects presents the most ideal opportunity to achieve this objective, it is not always possible to gain access to them. This paper proposes how the case study pedagogy using problem-based learning can be synergized with project-based learning to provide a feasible alternative. An integrative research model based on the IS development methodology acceptance theories is used to investigate the usefulness, satisfaction and acceptance of the proposed business innovation process."

Potter,"May 2009,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1542130.1542138,"In this paper, we discuss the motivating factors behind Information Technology (IT) professionals and what drives their choice of IT as a career. In order to explore this a series of interviews with thirteen IT professionals have been undertaken including a set of preliminary interviews, interviews with IT professionals from a consultancy organisation and a tertiary institution working on a common project, interviews with IT professionals in a large government organisation, and questionnaires distributed to an online community. The individuals participating in this study generally described exposure to technology at an early age and a subsequent interest in technology. These participants went on in later years to show an intrinsic motivation for pursuing technology. For this group of people the opportunity to interact with technology while young assisted them in developing an interest in working with technology and in retaining that interest."
Examining career orientations of information systems personnel in an emerging economy context,K. V. Mgaya,"May 2009,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1542130.1542139,"A number of studies on career orientations of information systems (IS) personnel have focused on developed countries. This study attempts to examine career anchors of IS personnel from the perspective of a developing country, Botswana. The results of the study show that IS personnel in Botswana exhibit career orientations similar to those identified in literature. However, there are some variations, which are attributed to cultural and socio-economic peculiarities. The study indicates that life style does not feature as a significant career anchor in Botswana. The dominant career anchors include organizational stability (security) and sense of service (service). Gender, age, and educational qualifications tend to moderate the career anchors significantly; thus creating a partition of the anchors across demographic groups."
Why students choose MIS: what makes a major-job-career in management information systems interesting?,Thomas W. Ferratt,"May 2009,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1542130.1542140,"Students choose a major based on a number of factors, with interest in the subject matter consistently being important. Given declining MIS enrollments at our university, we seek to understand our students' selection of a major so that we may take appropriate steps to address the decline. Besides understanding our situation better, we seek to contribute to the literature by developing a deeper understanding of what is meant by interest in the major. Our research is guided by the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Our primary focus is to examine students' expected outcomes that lead to attitudes, with a particular focus on aspects of an MIS major that generate interest in the major. We will use open-ended survey questions and conduct qualitative interviews with students at our university, including new and returning students, MIS and non-MIS majors. Results will be reported at the conference."

Implementation of an online intellectual community in a graduate educational setting,Daniel Firpo,"May 2009,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1542130.1542142,"Today, a significant portion of the student body lives far away from campus and are forced to take long commutes to and from campus. Such students are usually only able to come to campus once a week, and their fleeting presence on campus makes them detached from the intellectual community on campus. This study posits that information technology and ""Web 2.0 technology"" such as blogs and wikis can be used to expand the ""Claremont Conversation"" by mitigating the restrictions placed on communication by the need for same-time, same-place environments. As a part of an initiative envisioned by CGU President, Robert Klitgaard, titled ""Imagine CGU"" for the purpose of ""Imagining the future of CGU and the Claremont Conversation"", the phrase ""Claremont Conversation"" refers to conversations outside class among students and professors that help build an intellectual community that is the hallmark of a liberal education. This study describes the design and implementation of an initial project that targeted only the School of Information Systems and Technology (SISAT) at CGU. The artifact developed was an online community for the purpose of improving the sense-of-community amongst students, faculty, and alumni of the SISAT Department. This study then proposes future steps in how to improve the intellectual community at CGU by expanding the online intellectual community established for SISAT to the entire campus."

The effects of job security and other employment considerations on the organizational attitudes of IT professionals,Michael Harris,"May 2009,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1542130.1542146,"IT professionals have faced a labor market with extremely fluctuating demand. Labor market changes such as outsourcing and off-shoring can create concerns about job security, which in turn may affect IT professionals' organizational attitudes. This paper uses psychological contract theory to examine the effects of job security and other employment considerations of IT professionals on their organizational attitudes. Findings of the study suggest that job security, compensation, and new opportunities have a positive effect on their job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Based upon these findings, a discussion is provided on the structure of employment considerations."

Building on person-environment fit theory and utilizing survey data drawn from 21 state government IT departments, in this paper we examine the relationship between voluntary turnover and various aspects of the working environments which IT employees perceive to be unique to their profession (i.e., a departmental disposition toward learning and change, opportunities for cross-training, opportunities for job rotation, knowledgeable managers, knowledgeable colleagues, and work exhaustion). Work exhaustion, disposition toward learning and change, knowledgeable managers, and opportunities for cross training explained 30% of the variance in voluntary turnover intentions. Gender differences emerged."

While in the information economy, the focus was on training workers in information technology-related skills. The knowledge economy shifts an emphasis on skills that encourage innovation. The rationale behind this focus on innovation is that the information economy is driven by computer-related industries where work is geared towards the production and distribution of technologies. The knowledge economy however leverages these technologies for other uses as well as the creation of new technologies. This applies to all industries, and not just the core information technology industries."

The aim of this research has been to answer these questions. We interviewed thirteen experienced IT project managers from five organizations, focusing first on what the managers perceived as their most critical project management skills, and then on how they had developed those skills. We also discussed their exposure to a wide variety of organizational development interventions. By focusing on how project managers actually learned critical skills, we have been able to uncover the importance of informal learning channels, often involving project experiences, for the development of IT project management skills."

The job skills are organized in three broad categories: technical, humanistic and business skills. Findings suggest that the online advertisements list a strong mix of skills in these three categories, while practitioner literature tends to focus heavily on technical skills. The most recent practitioner literature, however, notes that CIOs are increasingly demanding business acumen as well as technical skills. Project management, financial analysis, and communication skills are the most frequently cited business skills. The scholarly literature tends to lag behind in terms of specific technical skills, but reports the richest set of IT job skills across the three categories."

This research in progress investigates how online information sharing can inform young people more effectively about the real implications of working as an IT professional. Ultimately, this research is aimed at understanding whether or not such online information and knowledge sharing can influence attitude change towards IT occupations using inoculation methods to ultimately attract them to the field. In this paper, we discuss existing literature of IT occupations, their culture and functions, the online information and knowledge sharing through social networking, and attitude change using inoculation as a method of persuasion. We describe our current efforts to create online communities of potential newcomers and those who are already part of the occupation, followed by presentation of the type of information that is intended to be shared."

A necessary clarification of the unfolding model of voluntary turnover,Gaetan Mourmant,"May 2009,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1542130.1542159,"The unfolding model of voluntary turnover, as tested by Niederman et al. [1], surprisingly appears to only capture 12% of the job leavers in IT, whereas when applied to other occupational groups, such as accountant or nurses, this ratio is much higher (respectively 92% and 77%). To address this issue, we take a closer look at the classification rules of the original model and we clarify them, highlighting the discrepancy between figure 1 of Lee et al. [2] and their written explanations, [3], [2]. Acknowledging a lack of clarity of those rules, we clarify the meaning of the logical impossibility of the joint existence of an engaged script with a search/evaluation of alternatives. In addition, we discuss the path-switching approach, [3]. Considering this clarification of the classification rules, we recalculate the results of two previous studies ([1] [4]) and we compare and assess those results with the other replications of the model. Those results suggest that a more parsimonious model (i.e. only path 1, 3 and 4b, with engaged script only present in path 1) may be sufficient to capture the majority of those leaving jobs in IT (74% and above)."
Gender stereotypes prevail in ICT: a research review,Kaylene L.

Gender stereotypes can influence girls' choices over time, reducing their confidence and interest in ICT and turning them away from ICT as an occupation. The stereotypes can give negative messages about girls' aptitude for ICT work and the types of activities, which should interest them. ICT stereotypes are predominantly negative, provide misleading ideas about ICT as a career discouraging both girls and boys, and make the field particularly unattractive to girls. Stereotypes introduced in the family and social environment are often reinforced by images in the mass media as well as widespread education practices. Very few mitigating influences (such as same sex schools) have any impact on these stereotypes."
Leveraging latent growth models to better understand MIS theory: a primer,Hemant Kher,"May 2009,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1542130.1542161,"The purpose of this didactic study is to demonstrate how latent growth models (LGM) can be utilized to measure changes in student's computer self efficacy (CSE) over time. LGM is a special application of structural equation modeling (SEM), an analytic tool that is popular among MIS researchers. LGMs have been used to study longitudinal changes in observed and/or latent variables over time in several other fields such as psychology, sociology, and management. To promote its use within MIS research, this paper provides a primer on the application of LGM using CSE data gathered from freshmen enrolled in the introduction to MIS class. We illustrate unconditional and conditional LGMs, and highlight the types of research questions such models can address. We discuss issues related to data requirements, model identification, estimation methods, sample size requirements, and model fit assessment statistics for LGMs, and conclude by providing avenues of further longitudinal research in MIS that can benefit from the use of LGMs."

Analyzing the London ambulance service's computer aided despatch (LASCAD) failure as a case of administrative evil,John Reid Landry,"May 2009,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1542130.1542163,"The 1992 failure of the London Ambulance Service's Computer Aided Despatch (LASCAD) system is well-known. This research suggests that it was not only a failure in a technical or methodological sense but that it was a case of administrative evil. Administrative evil is harm that well-meaning individuals unintentionally commit and remains hidden. Technical rationality and professional expertise create the system for this form of evil to occur. This paper discusses the notion of evil as it applies to organizational phenomena, describes the background and components of administrative evil, and examines the LASCAD case through the lens of administrative evil and the process of moral disengagement."
Nature versus nurture: an examination of factors that contribute to IT service quality,Janette Moody,"May 2009,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1542130.1542164,"As the IT unit increases its strategic alignment with the organization, technical people of all levels are required to become more customer-focused. It has been suggested that a service orientation on the part of IT personnel can be a contributing factor to the IT unit's service quality. However, IT workers do not exist in a vacuum, but must work within organizational constraints and incentives. Therefore, despite an IT worker's service orientation or lack thereof, these organizational factors may or may not encourage service oriented behaviors, which in turn affect perceived IT service quality. This research in progress examines the question: is a lack of service oriented skills on the part of IT workers, if such is the case, inherent in the individual personality (nature) or a function of the organizational environment in which he or she must function (nurture)?"
Human versus virtual moments: a proposed theoretical framework for understanding their implications in the workplace,Jon Blue,"May 2009,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1542130.1542165,"The benefits of computer-mediated communication (CMC) are compelling. Businesses leverage CMC to reduce costs, increase employee productivity, and even enable more flexible working arrangements (e.g., telecommuting). In contrast, researchers have also found that CMC has considerable weaknesses as compared to face-to-face (FTF) communication. Without the rich cues afforded by FTF contact, even casual use of CMC can result in feelings of detachment on the part of the sender and feelings of confusion on the part of the recipient. Research is apparently conflicted, therefore, over whether CMC inhibits or enhances relationships. Recent articles have posited that humans have a biological need for meaningful face-to-face exchanges, or ""human moments."" A human moment is defined as ""an authentic human encounter between two participating individuals that can happen only when they share the same physical space""... In contrast, a virtual moment is a dyadic interchange between participating individuals using CMC that results in shared understanding. This paper presents a new model to explain the relative merits of human versus virtual moments and their impact on emotional distance."

While research has examined generational attitudes regarding work, there are limited studies on the expectations of this newest workforce, the Millennials (born 1981- 1999), and even fewer concerning their attitudes towards teleworking. This study looks at the Millennials' attitudes toward autonomy, work/life balance, perceived computer competence and its relationship with telework preference. Using a survey instrument, a sample of Millennials and non-Millennials (GenXers, Baby Boomers and Traditionalists) were scrutinized to determine their preferences by group. A sample of 263 university students, faculty and staff represented 195 Millennials and 68 non-Millennials. Partial support was found for the effect of autonomy and work/life balance toward the preference to telework. Based on our results, Millennials do not seem to prefer teleworking. However, our analysis of differences between males and females depicted greater interest in males."

Cultural diversity of distributed teams,Mathieu Chauvet,"May 2009,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1542130.1542174,"The debate on distance teams, mostly virtual teams, has been especially prominent in the academic literature for the last few years. Among the different concepts that have been studied by researchers, little attention has been paid explicitly to national culture. Although sometimes presented as a positive element of virtual teams, cultural diversity is mainly considered as a barrier to their development and management. In this study, I identify several limitations of the prior literature and note the paucity of cross-cultural theories (other than of Hofstede's dimensions). As a solution, I propose a new framework that combines contributions of both essentialist and socio-constructivist perspectives of cross-cultural theories."
Boundary spanning in offshored ISD projects: a project social capital perspective,Poornima Krishnan,"May 2009,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1542130.1542175,"Offshore outsourcing of information systems application development (ISD) has grown tremendously in the past decade. Executing such projects requires collaboration from project participants across the client and vendor firms, located in different countries. However, orchestrating effective collaboration, across teams separated by geographic, organizational and cultural contexts, has emerged as a significant challenge in managing offshored projects. In this research, we examine the usefulness of boundary spanning in addressing this challenge. Specifically, we focus on the role of client project manager as a boundary spanner, connecting the distributed team members from both client and vendor firms, and facilitating expertise sharing and coordination. We present a multi-dimensional conceptualization of the boundary spanning activities of the client project manager. Utilizing an organizational capital perspective, we examine capital generated in offshore project teams through boundary spanning, as a potential mechanism through which boundary spanning effects successful project outcomes."

This finding has important implications for research on career interventions, for IT education and for the IT profession"
Determining students' intent to stay in it programs: an empirical model,Tracy L. Lewis,"April 2008,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1355238.1355241,"Current declining enrollment and attrition trends in IT programs have inspired an emerging body of literature: IT student retention. To shed some insight on whom leaves and stays in IT programs, the authors developed a new construct, computing resilience, and explored its influence on intent to stay and emotional intelligence. This study also investigated the linkage between ethnic identity, emotional intelligence, and IT student intent to stay. It was found that ethnic identity and computing resilience influence student retention through emotional intelligence. Implications for these findings for IT faculty, students, and administrators are discussed."

Firm-specificity and organizational learning-related scale on investment in internal human capital for open source software adoption,Yan Li,"April 2008,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1355238.1355244,"This study investigates two antecedents of organizational investment in the development of human capital in the context of Open Source Software (OSS). Survey data collected from 114 senior Information Technology (IT) managers and IT professionals indicates that an organization's perception of firm-specificity of OSS human capital and the extent of learning-related scale are positively associated with the investment it makes in cultivating internal OSS human capital. Additionally, we observed that learning-related scale moderates the impact of firm-specificity of OSS on its investment in human capital for OSS platform products."
The impact of staff turnover on software projects: the importance of understanding what makes software practitioners tick,Tracy Hall,"April 2008,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1355238.1355245,"In this paper we investigate the impact of staff turnover on software projects. In particular we investigate whether high staff turnover damages project success. We analyse data from an empirical study of 89 software practitioners to show that projects with high staff turnover are less successful. Furthermore our empirical data suggests a relationship between high staff turnover on projects and low staff motivation levels. We discuss factors which have been previously found to improve motivation levels and conclude that improving motivation levels can reduce staff turnover, which in turn increases project success."
What are we doing to improve recruitment and retention in information technology majors?,Indira R. Guzman,"April 2008,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1355238.1355247,"Excluding a few years surrounding the so called ""dot.com boom"" (i.e., 1998-2000) when people were pursuing IT majors as a likely way of making money, enrollments in information technology majors of students have continually dropped every year since 2001 (Babbitt, 2001; Frauenheim, 2004), suggesting that there is a general lack of interest in pursuing IT related majors among U.S. students (Vegso, 2005). On the other hand, there is growing evidence that it is critical for all organizations and countries to have qualified people who will work efficiently with current and emerging information technologies. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the U.S. Department of Labor provides employment projections with information about the labor market for the U.S. as a whole for 10 years in the future."

The major contribution of this research is a holistic model developed to uncover pre-college, formative norms and perceptions of high school girls towards IT careers and the demands associated with thriving in the field. The ultimate objective is to use Stage 1 of an IT Career Lifecycle model (to develop information technology career recruitment and retention strategies to attract girls and minorities to the IT profession) while they are enrolled in primary education. By focusing on Stage 1 of the model, we present propositions regarding the perceptions of the IT field and provide future direction for model testing based on our initial findings using a convenient sample of 411 girls aged fourteen to seventeen. Lastly, while IS literature primarily focuses on career experiences of working professionals, our work shifts the discourse to lend itself to the investigation of the more influential years associated with K-12."
Personal and situational predictors of IS professionals' career choice satisfaction,Deborah J.

However, women IT professionals also demonstrate mid-career turnover for reasons such as work-life balance, work exhaustion, role ambiguity, role conflict, and growth needs. This study explores alienation among women IT professionals and examines factors that lead to work alienation and abandonment of IT careers. Such alienation appears to be less prevalent in Asian countries where women perceive IT careers to be more conducive to female participation. A comparison among women from American and Asian cultures is proposed."

This paper discusses how the technical rational paradigm supports the creation of systems that embody administrative evil. Unlike the typical notions of harm created by malevolent and unethical individuals, the processes and structures that create administrative evil rely on good people acting within their professional roles to design the systems [1]. This is a research-in-progress to determine if information systems can harm or be evil, the frequency of harm, and response to harm by designers and users."
Assessing and managing employee readiness for embracing e-business,J.-Y. Lai,"April 2008,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1355238.1355257,"It is imperative for business to use network and distributed information technology in purpose of integrating resources among organizations, vendors, employees, and suppliers to maximize the value-added in the competitive business environment. This causes organizations to implement electronic business (e-business) at an accelerating pace and has fueled predictions and speculations about how ready are their employees to embrace this new type of firms. Unfortunately, there is very sparse scholarly research paid on this issue. Thus, drawing on insights from the extant literature and interviews with practitioners, this article first proposes the construct of employee readiness for e-business (EREB) and its conceptualization. Then it describes a program of research that was undertaken to develop an EREB instrument by defining, operationalizing, and purifying the construct into a multi-item scale to measure it, and assessing the scale's psychometric properties. By strictly iterative processes, a well-validated EREB instrument was presented. The instrument and its comprehensive model proposed in this paper would be contributive to researchers and practitioners interested in designing, implementing, and managing e-business."

Preparing the millennial generation for the work place: how can academia help?,Debbie Beard,"April 2008,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1355238.1355264,"Just like universities, employers are recognizing significant differences in the current generation - herein referred to as Millennials - of students and graduates compared to Generation X. Unlike in academia, the situation is more complex in the workplace which involves the complex interactions of three generations with managers from Generation X mediating and managing the transition of the new Millennial recruits who are replacing the retiring Baby Boomers. In this paper, the authors select the relevant Millennial generation's characteristics from earlier studies, extract from those characteristics a set of opportunities these characteristics offer to educators and future employers as well as a set of threats those characteristics may pose to their career development process. The authors then suggest, based on the observed career development opportunities, a specific set of strategies for the employers in assimilating the new graduates into the workplace environment. Further, they will discuss a set of support activities, which serve as countermeasures for mitigating the observed threats, academia could use for the Millennial students' career development. The paper attempts to offer suggestions for closing the workforce generation gaps and for preparing the Millennial graduates for a smoother transition as they enter the workforce."
Locating and disseminating effective messages: enhancing gender representation in computing majors and careers,Brenda L. Berkelaar,"April 2008,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1355238.1355265,"Numerous researchers have documented the declining numbers of women seeking and receiving bachelor's degrees in computing (e.g. [3][9][15]). Early research suggests this pattern does not apply across all institution types (e.g. [7][11]), computing specialties, or cultures [12][14]. Most of the current research on women in STEM is drawn from computing, engineering, and education perspectives, and focuses on educational, social, and cultural issues [9][12][14] and career socialization [8][10]. No research to date has addressed computing major and career choice from a communication lens. Because perceived characteristics of majors contribute to career choice [4] understanding the messages that influence these choices offers opportunities for interventions to change the portrayal of computing. We hypothesize that memorable messages about computing careers differ by gender and institution type, influencing career and major choice. Using a communication lens and qualitative and quantitative techniques, we examine how memorable messages and their sources relate to recruitment and retention of students in computing. Results will inform new message campaign strategies to address the underrepresentation of women in computer disciplines1"
The role of technology and authentic task contexts in promoting inclusive learning for disabled and non-disabled college students,Conrad Shayo,"April 2008,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1355238.1355266,"Although most online courses offered by institutions of higher learning are accessible to both the disabled and non-disabled student population, little empirical research is available on how inclusive the online courses are. Fulfilling mandated accessibility requirements may not always connote inclusivity. As such, educational institutions may unwittingly foster separate educational tracks for disabled Vs non-disabled students; while simultaneously paying mere lip service to the notion of ""making reasonable accommodations"" for their disabled student population as required by law. In this research project, we intend to use our current understanding of how humans learn in technology enabled environments and findings in cognitive neuroscience, to develop and assess the effectiveness of online course materials that will be made inclusively accessible to both disabled and non-disabled students. Our initial focus is on Science, Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) online courses offered to college level blind and deaf as well as sighted/hearing students."

However, issues regarding how to evaluate and manage the success/effective of e-business are still scant from viewpoints of internal service quality and job satisfaction, not to speak of forming a strategic planning for managers to improve job satisfaction through internal service quality. Hence, the first purpose of this paper aims to explore the relationship between internal service quality and job satisfaction in the context of e-business. The exhausted literature reviews of prior research on service quality dimensions such as reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy, and related work on employees' job satisfaction have been reviewed. Then, the relationships between internal service quality and employees' job satisfaction are developed and examined. By conducting a survey of 147 respondents practicing at six international semiconductor manufacturing companies in Science-based Parks in Taiwan, this paper explores how internal service delivered by e-business affects employees' job satisfaction in the context of e-business. The results support three dimensions of internal service quality indeed have influences on employees' job satisfaction. Finally, we propose a service quality-importance of fit (SQ-IF) strategic grid for managers to initialize a strategy for improving job satisfaction. Based on these findings and the SQ-IF grid, we demonstrate some managerial implications for practitioners to improve employees' job satisfaction through enhancing service quality."

Does knowledge work pay?: an archival analysis of knowledge management activities,Wei-Cheng Shen,"April 2008,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1355238.1355281,"The term 'knowledge worker' (KW) has been frequently used in mass media, research, and academia, especially in the era of the knowledge economy. Nevertheless, various researchers define KW from different economic perspectives. Instead of dichotomizing an occupation to be a KW or not, this research carefully scrutinizes detailed job descriptions of various occupations to determine the degree to which they are involved in various aspects of knowledge management (KM) activities. Based on the results, this research provides some exploratory evidence about the characteristics of KWs. The occupational wage comparisons between workers with higher and lower involvement in knowledge work enable this research to determine whether the market financially rewards KM activities of individuals. Moreover, comparisons among different aspects of knowledge work indicate economic differences associated with those KM activities. Findings of this research are expected to provide finer classifications for KW, to better understand the characteristics of KW, and to recognize the economic importance of KM activities, yielding implications for employees, educators, trainers, firms, and governments to face the challenges of the knowledge economy."

Galup,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235011,"This panel will discuss the importance of IT Service Management (ITSM) to business-school IT and MIS curricula. The goals of the panel are to provide both a business and a philosophical basis for including IT Service Management offerings in business school IT educational programs, provide a forum for questions, and begin to educate attendees of the need to include ITSM offerings in their programs. The panel will define service management, discuss how ITSM works with IT management and operations management, discuss how to integrate systems development and service management, and describe industry needs and how business school education can address those needs. The group will engage the audience in discussing ITSM educational programs."
Examining user resistance and management strategies in enterprise system implementations,Tim Klaus,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235013,"This paper is an initial investigation of the management strategies best suited to address user resistance. Despite its relationship to adoption, little is known about user resistance. User resistance is investigated in the enterprise systems (ES) environment because the complexity and richness of ES leads users to manifest the full range of resistant behaviors and beliefs. The Q-methodology revealed eight naturally-existing types of ES resistance and the management strategies preferred by each respective group. The results have implications for both research in the field of user resistance and adoption, and practitioners involved in system implementation."
Research in progress: where are all the people? the curious case of one-person IT departments,Willy Dertz,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235014,"In this paper, we present a research-in-progress study that examines the characteristics of IT-departments that consist of a single employee. Spurred by the findings of a master's student project, we examined the data from another study we had conducted that revealed that fully 44% of municipalities in a Scandinavian country have such one-person-departments. Our survey also revealed that these ""departments"" provide full service to the municipalities which are quite heavy users of IT services. The obvious question is ""how is it possible for the apparently skeletal IT department to provide full service?"" Have we stumbled upon a new form of organizing the IT function? In this paper, we aim to map such departments to the models and frameworks that appear in the IS literature. We plan to conduct a series of interpretive case studies to understand how and why this structure emerged and what implications this has for IT personnel employed in these departments and the IT service delivery for organizations."
National information technology policy in a globalized world: building an IT workforce for Venezuela,Edgar A. Maldonado,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235015,"In this paper we examine the effects of globalization on national level information technology (IT) policy. We compare national-level IT policies leading toward the development of a national-level information economy. We examine the IT policies from two long-established, successful, developed countries, Japan and Germany, distilling common policy elements. We then compare those elements to the newly created IT policy for the developing country of Venezuela, which is making the first, tentative steps toward developing an internal IT workforce. This new policy stresses the need for technological independence in a globalizing world and creation and maintenance of highly trained IT human resources. Due to the recent oil boom, Venezuela has claimed economic power and has the potential to provide Venezuela with opportunities that nations in similar stages of development do not have. Most importantly we stress the need for Venezuela to create national-level IT policy that fits it own needs."

These skills are increasingly recognized as key to success in IT-related disciplines [1, 5]."
"Worldwide digital divide: influences of education, workforce, economic, and policy factors on information technology",James B. Pick,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235019,"The research goal is to analyze the influence of education, workforce, economic, and policy factors on ICT usage, expenditure, and infrastructure in 67 countries. Findings indicate importance of R&D capacity, foreign direct investment, government prioritization of ICT, and math/science education. The findings that technology factors in poorer nations are more strongly associated with foreign direct investment and government initiatives contrast with this and other studies of more prosperous countries. The paper suggests policy steps that can be taken by national governments to foster the effective use of technology and reduce the digital divide including encouraging creative workforce, and emphasizing education, and fostering R&D."
Does IT outsourcing create firm value?,Christine Koh,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235020,"The continued growth of IT outsourcing seems to reflect a fundamental belief among businesses that outsourcing creates wealth and delivers value to companies that outsource. Such a belief is supported by theories of production and transaction cost economies. These theories suggest that IT outsourcing should indeed generate greater wealth and create greater value for firms that outsource vis-Ã -vis firms that prefer to manage and operate their IT in-house. Yet, to date, there is little objective evidence to show how IT outsourcing actually does create value to companies. Drawing on transaction and production cost economies, we argue that IT outsourcing should create value for firms. We test our hypothesis using an event study of 420 IT outsourcing announcements by U.S. public listed companies during the period 1989-1999. Results showed that IT outsourcing did create value for firms in terms of positive short-term stock market returns."

"Industry certification and academic degrees: complementary, or poles apart?",Leo Hitchcock,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235023,"University ICT degrees give students a well-rounded, broad base with which to move into industry. Graduates may however find that without specific product skills many employers may be reluctant to hire them [9]. One method of credentialing for specific products that has become predominant, described as a ""parallel universe"" [1], and that many advocate as being complementary to and may integrate with academic degrees, is industry-based certification. Some however, see industry certification as product-specific training, and academic degrees as education, with each being completely different markets. This discussion informs and advances that debate."
Current and future entry-level IT workforce needs in organizations,"John ""Skip"" Benamati","April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235024,"The IS discipline is under scrutiny. Most IS academic programs are struggling to reverse recent declining enrollment trends. At the same time, the nature of entry-level IS positions is changing. Thirteen IS executives were interviewed to learn their views on the state of the entry-level IS job market and what skills today's IS graduates lack most. Findings indicate programming skills are still needed, and project management skills are both highly desired and lacking. Other soft skills, such as communications skills, business knowledge, and leadership skills are also desired and, like project management, projected to increase in importance."
The impact of the skills gap on the recruitment of MIS graduates,Andrew Aken,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235025,"Enrollment in MIS degree programs has been dropping significantly since 2001. Some of the reasons for this decline include the perceived lack of jobs for MIS graduates, confusion over the variety of computing degree programs, disinterest in MIS careers, and MIS programs which fail to prepare students adequately for careers in MIS. This paper looks at each of these potential causes for the enrollment decline and offers suggestions to reverse this trend. Given the lack of material support for the first three potential causes of the decline in enrollment, the bulk of this research is devoted to investigating the deficiencies of the MIS program from the employer's perspective."
A regional IT occupational partnership for economic development,Eileen M. Trauth,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235026,"Increasingly, the economic viability of regions, states and countries is being linked to the viability of technology-enabled, knowledge-intensive economic sectors. Hence, among the factors of interest in regional economic development is the availability of an information technology (IT) talent pool. There is a growing need to understand the regional supply and demand dynamics of appropriately educated IT professionals. Consequently, an action research project was undertaken in Berks County, Pennsylvania in order to better understand the IT skill and knowledge requirements of the local labor force. An occupational partnership representing three constituencies -- academe, local industry and government -- joined forces in order to develop a sustainable mechanism for ensuring the continuance of a qualified IT labor force."

What do women want?: an investigation of career anchors among women in the IT workforce,Jeria L. Quesenberry,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235030,"In an attempt to address the underrepresentation of women in the information technology (IT) workforce it is important to understand the values and motivations of female professionals. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to examine career anchors of women in the IT workforce and how these factors are manifested in their careers. In doing so, we examine data from a field study of 92 female IT practitioners. Three important findings resulted from this exploration. First, technical competence and managerial competence are mutually exclusive. Second, a combination of career anchors for a given individual can be found. Third, career anchors vary in terms of temporal characteristics."
Multiple stakeholders' perceptions of critical attributes of a top performer: exploring the effects of congruency,K. D. Joshi,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235031,"Many IT jobs have multiple performance dimensions, requiring employees to perform several different functions. When job performance is multi-dimensional and difficult to measure objectively, employees are evaluated by subjective ratings of various traits, skills, and/or behaviors. Because IT professionals often interact with different functional groups within an organization, multiple stakeholders may evaluate their performance. This study examines the impact of congruity among different organizational stakeholders' prototypes of successful IT performers on job performance. The data was collected from a large international consulting firm. The results of this study support the hypotheses that congruence of stakeholder perceptions affects IT personnel performance. They also reinforce the frequently observed findings that performance positively affects job satisfaction while higher levels of job satisfaction leads to lower intention to turnover."
How personality type influences decision paths in the unfolding model of voluntary job turnover: an application to IS professionals,GaÃ«tan Mourmant,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235032,"A new model for understanding job turnover was introduced into the management literature a decade ago [26], analyzing the process by which employees decide to leave their jobs. This ""unfolding model of voluntary turnover"" is a radical departure from traditional models of job turnover, positing that turnover is not necessarily triggered by job dissatisfaction. In addition to empirical testing with nurses, accountants, and other knowledge workers, the unfolding model has also been applied to study IS personnel. Based on a study of IS graduates from two American universities, Niederman and Sumner [34] concluded that IS employees appear not to follow the common decision paths identified by Lee and Mitchell in their initial conceptualization of the unfolding model; instead, a vast majority of respondents followed turnover decisions path not specified in the model. Although other modifications to the model have since been made [12], it is still not clear why the study of IS professionals diverged so much from prior studies of other types of knowledge workers. We first explore and identify the divergence of results between IS employees and other occupations that have been studied with the model, and then propose that an individual's personality type can affect the likelihood that he or she will follow specific decision paths in the model -- such as leaving without having a new job arranged in advance. We contribute to the IS personnel literature by offering a novel explanation for the divergence in prior empirical results. In addition, by examining personality type, we seek to open a new area of study, in terms of examining the relationship between personality type and employees' preferences for following certain paths leading to job turnover."
Knowledge contribution in problem solving virtual communities: the mediating role of individual motivations,Jie Yu,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235034,"Increasing knowledge contribution in problem solving virtual communities (PSVCs) is a long-pursued question in the knowledge management arena for both researchers and practitioners. In view of various mechanisms developed in hopes of encouraging more active participations, we proposed a motivational model for PSVC contributions. Drawn on functional motivation theory and expectancy-value theory, we highlight the mediating role of individual motivations in the relationships between characteristics of PSVCs and knowledge contribution intention. By taking both self-interest and public-good perspectives, we identify eight individual motivations to knowledge contribution in the context of PSVCs. They are active learning, self-enhancement, reciprocity, reputation, enjoyment of helping others, self-protection, moral obligation and advancement of virtual community motive. Besides, we also identify four major mechanisms in PSVCs that are associated with members' motivations: codification, identity management, virtual community norms and communication methods."
Understanding member motivation for contributing to different types of virtual communities: a proposed framework,Trevor D. Moore,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235035,"Previous research indicates that the type and purpose of a virtual community (wiki, blog, and Internet Forum) may play a role in determining a member's motivation for contribution to a virtual community, but does not fully explore this idea. This study aggregates the disparate ideas and terminology of previous research on virtual communities and presents a more parsimonious grouping of fourteen motivational factors. These fourteen factors provide a framework for examining what drives members to contribute. Two preliminary studies offer some support for the framework."
Individual performance in knowledge intensive work through social networks,Kon Shing Kenneth Chung,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235036,"Studies in Information Systems (IS) research have widely documented task-oriented and communication structure effects as a result of information and communication technology (ICT) use. These effects have been evidenced at inter- and intra-organisational and occupational community levels. Research on the direct interplay between social network structure, ICT use and individual performance is however lacking to date. This research proposes a theoretical model along with operational constructs for understanding how performance of individuals in knowledge-intensive work can be affected by social network structure and ICT use. The context of the study is the occupational community of general practitioners (GP) in rural New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Numerous problems such as decreasing performance with age, obsolescence of technological knowledge, isolation from urban communities and various problems specific to rural practice makes this study significant. The study is motivated by the research question -- ""How can the interplay between social network structure and ICT use enhance individual performance?"" It argues that individuals with high levels of ICT use, dense social network structures and those rich in connections to social clusters or groups who are themselves not well connected perform better."
A comparative study of IT/IS job skills and job definitions,H. James Nelson,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235038,"Do large firms have a pattern of utilizing certain types of IT/IS skills more than others? Do individuals need to have one set of IT/IS skills for Fortune 500 companies and another set of skills for small-sized firms? Understanding the set of skills required for IT/IS jobs is of importance to professionals as it governs their employability as well as their decisions to seek professional certifications. Meanwhile, the trend of job outsourcing means that certain types of jobs are kept in-house in firms while other types are contracted out. It thus becomes paramount for professionals to know the skill set that is required to preserve their employability in the job market. This ongoing study evaluates the skills required for IT/IS jobs by analyzing a broad set of online job descriptions. An initial set of data has been gathered through an automated retrieval of jobs descriptions from online sites. This data set will be analyzed using Latent Semantic Clustering which will result in a quantitative classification system of IT/IS jobs. The comparison of job skill requirements between small and large-sized firms is another expected result of this study. The contribution of this study is expected to be the determination of patterns of skills required for IT/IS jobs, a non-judgmental and quantitatively based definition of IT/IS jobs, and the investigation of differences in hiring patterns between firms of varying sizes."
Perspective-driven IT talent acquisition,Makoto Nakayama,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235039,"This paper presents a theoretical framework based on exploratory research so IT managers can plan and procure their organization's IT skills more effectively. Open-ended interviews revealed that IT managers have difficulty in describing specific profiles of the ideal IT candidate. In contrast, IT managers are very specific for an existing open position. Yet, when asked about their IT skills portfolio (at the organizational or individual level), both IT managers and IT professionals had difficulty in articulating its strengths and weaknesses. This is partly because IT is rapidly changing and evolving, often unpredictably. In addition, while the existing IT skills taxonomies have commonalities, their anchors are arbitrary choices of career levels, technologies, job domains, task types and responsibility levels. These taxonomies often confuse IT professionals because there are no many bases for anchoring skills. This proposed framework uses three skills management perspectives (task-oriented, fundamental skill, and socio-cultural) to prioritize the countless IT skills into more manageable scopes. The combination of critical factors for a job position (technology/firm specificity, job tenure, organization size) dictates which perspective is most appropriate, thus giving to an IT manager a focus for analyzing IT skills."
Incorporating soft skills into accounting and MIS curricula,Debbie Beard,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235040,"Faculty face many challenges both in and outside the confines of the university setting. They must increase the number of topics and the depth in which the material is covered while simultaneously reducing the number of required degree hours. In addition, employers have acknowledged an overall decline of soft skills among today's graduates. Further, faculty must address their material coverage for the multi-tasking skills of today's college students. In this article, the authors address the concerns voiced by the employers of college graduates regarding the apparent absence of soft skills competence and suggest an assurance of learning model for incorporating these skills into curricula."
An artifact-centric framework for software development skills,Jack Downey,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235042,"While the specific knowledge, skills and abilities needed to develop software can be determined, it is much more difficult to decide what skill set is required for any given software development role. This paper suggests that progress may be made if, instead of trying to relate knowledge, skills or abilities to individual roles, efforts are made to understand what knowledge, skills and abilities are required to create and use the artifacts associated with software development. To this end, a framework incorporating two relationships is presented: The first relates software development artifacts to organizational functions, while the second relates knowledge, skills and abilities to different phases of an artifact's lifecycle. This framework leads to a new taxonomy of skills."
the neglected technical skill?,Tracy Hall,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235043,"In this paper we discuss the importance of communication in software development. Communication has long been recognized as an important element of a successful software project. The quality of communication within the development team and between the development team and external entities impacts on the performance of the software project. However there is little evidence to suggest that approaches to software development have adequately emphasized high quality communications. Our findings suggest that the SEI's family of Capability Maturity Models, arguably the most influential models of software development, address communication in a very superficial way. We consider the impact of poor communication on the performance of a team of developers working in a software organization that has been assessed at CMM Level 5. We conducted multi-level interviews with all developers in the software team. Our main findings are that, although the team recognizes the importance of communication, many communication problems are reported. Furthermore, we found that human-centric processes, such as communication, were much less mature than the technical processes. We discuss the typical personality traits that may mitigate against developers being good communicators. We conclude that one way to overcome this is for development models to address communication more explicitly."
Assessing the contributions of business and IT knowledge to the development of IT/business partnerships,GeneviÃ¨ve Bassellier,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235044,"With the increasing interdependency between IT and business, a challenge for organizations is to strengthen the relationships and communications between people with different levels of IT and business knowledge. One solution that has been suggested is to create an overlap of knowledge and expertise between IT and business people. Thus far, studies have focused on the cross-functional knowledge in partners. In this study, we examine knowledge in both the IT and business domains in both partners. Specifically, we investigate the contribution of four types of knowledge: IT knowledge in business people, IT knowledge in IT professionals, business knowledge in business people, and the business knowledge in IT professionals. This will allow us to assess not only the contribution of cross-functional knowledge, but also (1) the contribution of the partners' own domain knowledge; and (2) the role of the overall IT (in both partners) and overall business knowledge (in both partners). This increase in each other's domain knowledge is expected to contribute to the development of a better understanding for each other's jobs. This shared understanding between the partners will contribute to better partnerships. To test these propositions we gathered data from 85 projects through a cross-sectional survey. Respondents reported on cross-functional dyadic relationships with peers at work. The results will provide direction for managing different assets of knowledge."

Understanding multicultural differences in online satisfaction,Kyootai Lee,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235048,"Understanding cultural divergence and issues related to it are vital for enhancing international business. With the global reach of Internet, it is important to study consumer behavior across cultures related to online shopping. As part of an ongoing research project, this study identifies a model of online consumer satisfaction, and aims to empirically investigate the model in the context of three different cultures, namely the UK, United States, and South Korea. An integrated model developed by Lee and Joshi (2006b) is adopted to empirically test the differences in antecedent influences on online consumer satisfaction. The model relies on literature and theoretical foundations provided by psychology, marketing, and MIS literature."

This paper presents the initial data results collected in the above five countries. So far, our preliminary data supports previous findings in that adaptation to the occupational culture in the information technology field predicts occupational commitment and more significantly affective occupational commitment. While no significant differences were found across countries, further analysis is currently being conducted to evaluate possible differences by gender and nationality."

I define these activities as IS personnel resizing. In this study, I examine the relationship between IS personnel resizing and employee job outcomes, in the wake of IT outsourcing. I apply a psychological contract lens to understand employment expectations of IS employees and examine the issues that arise when IT-user firms eliminate or reorganize IS personnel."
Transactive memory system development in virtual teams: the potential role of shared identity and shared context,Yide Shen,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235054,"Transactive Memory Systems (TMS) is a concept describing team members' awareness of knowledge possessed by their coworkers, which has been shown to be valuable for team effectiveness in learning, viability, and overall performance [15, 17, 22, 28]. Previous research on TMS has focused primarily on traditional face-to-face teams with only a few studies proposing that TMS development is more difficult in virtual teams. The goal of this research is to study TMS development in virtual teams through an empirical investigation. The first purpose of this research is to examine the impact of two factors -- shared identity and shared context -- on TMS development in virtual teams. Another purpose of this research is to investigate whether computer-mediated communication (CMC) used for group interaction will change the impact of shared identity and shared context. General methodology considerations are stated for future research that will subsequently be conducted."
A proposal for a model on media selection,Hirotoshi Takeda,"April 2007,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1235000.1235055,"This proposal acknowledges that people select media in communication frequently. Sometimes the media selection may not utilize the best mode of communication available. Individuals often select communication media inconsistent with the full technical capabilities of those media and non-technical modes of communication like face to face communication. For example, they use instant messaging when face-to-face, the richest form of communication, is available. They also use text messaging when voice communication, a more technically advanced mode of communication, is possible. The study described in this proposal will apply media richness theory to explain some of the choices made by such individuals. The proposed research will add variables to better explain media selection than has been previously done. The major contribution of the research will be the development and testing of a model that explains organizational media selection."

To address this unmet need, organizations are fervently looking for ways to create a sustainable IT professional assembly line of educated and highly skilled workers with strong social networks and exceptional team-based organizational skills. While the IT workforce field has been heavily researched, the majority of this investigation gives little to no discussion to the role under-represented groups of virtual social networks will play in addressing this concern in our knowledge economy. This paper explores how existing social networks of minority Greek-letter organizations possess high IT soft skills to meet this need. It concludes by highlighting key implications for the IT workforce today and in the years to come."
Cross-cultural influences on women in the IT workforce,Eileen M. Trauth,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125178,"A review of 862 papers published in SIGMIS/CPR proceedings over the past 44 years revealed only 29 articles that focused on gender and the IT workforce or gender and IT education, the majority of which were presented at the 2003 conference whose theme was diversity in the IT workforce. Therefore, in response to the call for papers to extend our understanding of topics central to computer personnel research, we present data from our field study of gender and IT that is directed at understanding differing cross-cultural influences on female experiences in the IT workforce. Four themes emerged from analysis of data from four separate studies of women in the IT workforces in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United States: motherhood and careers, career choice, family dynamics and gender stereotypes. Analysis of interviews with 167 women reveals a wide range of influences on women's choice of an IT career. These results lend empirical support to the individual differences theory of gender and IT as an alternative to essentialist or social construction theories."

Motivating open source software developers: influence of transformational and transactional leaderships,Yan Li,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125182,"Open Source Software (OSS) is developed by geographically distributed unpaid programmers. The success of such a seemingly chaotic OSS project will largely depend on how the project leader organizes and motivates the developers to contribute. Grounded on leadership and motivation theories, we proposed and tested a research model that seeks to explain the behavioral effects of a leader on the developers' motivation to contribute. Survey data collected from 118 OSS developers on Sourceforge.net was used to test the research model. The results indicate that leaders' transformational leadership is positively related to developers' intrinsic motivation and leaders' active management by exception, a form of transactional leadership, is positively related to developers' extrinsic motivation."

IT HRM practices: best practices vs. configurations,Jayesh Prasad,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125186,"The management of information technology (IT) professionals is an important managerial concern. The way that IT organizations manage their IT professionals is essentially manifested in their implementation of human resource management (HRM) practices, such as those related to career development, pay, and job security. Ferratt et al. (2005) describe two contrasting modes of theorizing about how HRM practices should be combined to yield desired outcomes: universalistic (or ""best-practices"") and configurational. They call for an examination of the assumptions underlying these modes of theorizing. Our examination yields the following proposition: The complex configurational mode of theorizing has value in explaining a success criterion (such as turnover) beyond that of the simple universalistic mode. We collected data from members of a national professional organization of IT employees on a number of IT HRM practices and a success criterion. Analysis of variance allows us to test the proposition. The independent variables are the IT HRM practices plus a profile variable representing various configurations of practices. A significant profile variable indicates that the variance in the success criterion explained by configurations is significantly greater than the variance explained by the individual IT HRM practices acting independently, thereby supporting an inference of synergism in combining the practices. The results of these tests, when completed, will be used to suggest directions for managing IT professionals and future IT HRM theory development and testing."
The IT/IS job market: a longitudinal perspective,Chuck Litecky,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125187,"This paper describes parallels between the IS/IT job market of the 1990's to that of the current decade using longitudinal data collected for these periods from job position ads. Although the data exhibits some measurement issues, it offers insight into the relative size of the specialized job market for IS/IT personnel at its peak in the late 90's to the relative size of the job market at its trough in the early 2000's and concludes a partial recovery now in the mid 2000's.Since the relative size of the IS/IT job market can be viewed as a driving force for much related activity in recruiting, personnel selection and collegiate education, this data may be useful for those interested in computer personnel, particularly in MIS positions. In contrast to governmental statistics gathered on broad definitions of computer personnel (c.f. [10], [4]), this research focuses on skills related to MIS personnel and some IT positions based upon specialized subsets of advertised job skills.The skills demanded in the job market have changed over the last decade. For example, although application and web development skills are still in demand, the programming languages and tools used for development have changed. At the same time, the well publicized downturn in enrolment in MIS programs means that there will be fewer graduates seeking positions in the next few years. This may very well result in a shortage of personnel with current skills."
Development of an integrated model of customer satisfaction with online shopping,Kyootai Lee,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125188,"Consumer satisfaction is critically important for the success of a Web based online store.

Our analysis identifies issues related to channel traits, Web store traits, and consumer traits as factors that may help influence customer satisfaction."
Occupations and careers in computer networking and infrastructure management: implications for IS programs,Stephen Hawk,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125190,"This paper describes the research questions and methodology of a study that will investigate work done in the computer networking field. Because we are uncertain what occupations will be found in this area, this study will look more broadly at occupations in firms' IT infrastructure that may also involve computer networking. This research focuses on identifying the occupations that exist in computer networking and infrastructure and the typical career paths available to those who work in this area.The study will also identify the skill requirements for these occupations and the backgrounds that employees in this area usually have. Besides helping to characterize the occupations in this area, examining skill requirements and employee backgrounds could help in understanding the role that IS programs play, or could potentially play, in preparing students for work in computer networking.The methodology will be to interview senior managers of IT infrastructure and computer networking functions using a set of open ended questions in about 20 medium to large-size organizations. Additionally, an instrument will be used to collect information about the tasks, duties and skill requirements for occupations in this area."
Microsourcing -- using information technology to create unexpected work relationships and entrepreneurial opportunities: work in progress,Lorie Obal,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125191,"The growing phenomenon of outsourcing, both onshore and offshore, has gained a great deal of attention and enabled the formation of new, flexible business models. It is of particular interest to portable enterprises such as programming and other producers of intellectual property. Economic changes as well as shifts in traditional work models and the employee/employer relationships have created new career pressures for knowledge workers as well as potential opportunities to use these new work models for either legitimate or illegitimate means. This work in progress proposes to open a new line of inquiry into the potential for employees to sub-contract their own work."

We discuss our data collection strategies and describe our plans for future research."
"Genetic database optimization: how data inspection and consideration, provides for index compression and record access optimization of genetic databases",Givon Zirkind,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125194,"With the many advances in computer hardware, the constant and historical challenges of optimization in processing and data storage appeared to have diminished if not disappeared almost entirely. However, even as hard drives grow larger and larger, while prices keep dropping; and the same occurring to memory; computer programs have turned more and more into bloatware - bringing computer usage back to its starting point and original engineering issues of efficiency. [12] Likewise, (CPU) processing speed appeared to have made efficiency and streamlining of program code, virtually a non-issue. Again, however, the relatively new field of genetic research has provided the perfect regeneration of the classical challenges to computer engineers - efficient programming, streamlined code, optimization for processing speed and maximum use of data storage. Genetic research requires maximum optimization of programming and data storage access because, genetic research uses extremely large databases, with extremely large indexes, with complex search criteria, with an extremely large number of inquiries and searches are commonly initiated remotely. Often, search requests are initiated over long geographic distances. [The most commonly used, popular and information rich genetic databases are The National Center for Biotechnology (USA); the EMBL Data Library, European Bioinformatics Institute, UK and; DNA Data Bank of Japan. [19] To improve database performance, indexing access speed, and reduce index size, the author developed a new, genetic database, herein discussed."
The contribution of knowledge management systems to interorganizational learning,Marla Beth Greenman,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125195,"Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) are thought to be useful in facilitating Interorganizational Learning (IOL) and in providing competitive advantage. Often these systems are shared across complex networked organizations and the relationships between the allied organizations may even depend on the quality of the systems they share. This paper presents a research-in-progress proposal which will consist of ten exploratory case studies as part of a program of doctoral research. The cases will examine IOL when a KMS is used to facilitate the partnership between the organizations.The cases all involve a partnership between Microsoft Business Solutions (MBS) and the Value-Added Resellers/Consulting firms that represent several MBS product lines. Organizational transparency, organizational receptivity, relative absorptive capacity, intent of the partners and partner success will all be explored as to how they influence IOL in the context of a specific KMS provided by Microsoft."

Leading information technology in South Africa: a unique challenge,Nina Evans,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125198,"During the past ten years South Africa has gone through many irreversible changes, which brought about many challenges, opportunities and uncertainties for South African leaders. Apart from that, organizations increasingly turn to information and communication technologies (ICT) to gain a competitive advantage in the hyper-competitive business market. The ICT leader/CIO stands at the center of change and much more is expected of this position as the role is being transformed to that of a valuable business leader. Not only do these leaders have to compete for local market share, but they must also enter and compete in the international market. Add to this the unique political situation and cultural diversity in post-apartheid South Africa together with the tremendous challenge to change the representation of women in the ICT industry and a very challenging situation for the ICT leader results. This article discusses perceptions of South African ICT executives and CIOs (both male and female) about the challenges they face, their role and responsibilities, as well as the essential capabilities required of them in the modern South African organization."
A framework for a generic business behaviour guideline (GBBG) for ICT organisations in the 'new' South Africa,Louise van der Linde,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125199,This paper reports on research in progress which investigates the need for a set of generic guidelines for acceptable business behaviour in Information and Communication Technology organisations in the 'new' South Africa. The investigation focuses on managers and employees in ICT organizations from before the democratic elections in 1994 in South Africa up to this day. It looks at the impact of different ethnic and individual cultures on different organisational cultures. Emphasis is placed on the impact of affirmative action (AA) and black economic empowerment (BEE) on ICT organizations and the perceived lack of skills and experience in affirmative action candidates. The inherently under-developed in interpersonal skills of many ICT professionals seem to aggravate the situation. Some organisations attempt to adapt their organisational culture to accommodate new ethnic cultures in the organisation. The purpose of the research is to determine the need for a set of generic business behaviour guidelines for employees in the ICT industry and to design the framework of a Generic Business Behaviour Guideline (GBBG) document/manual.
Examining the relationship between gender and the research productivity of IS faculty,Michael J. Gallivan,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125201,"In this study, we examine whether there exist gender differences between the rates of scholarly publications by IS researchers. Triggered, in part, by a recent study of so-called ""top"" IS researchers that featured just two women out of the leading 30 IS scholars [24], we sought to determine whether women IS scholars publish at rates similar to their male counterparts in the leading, scholarly IS journals. Using a different ""basket"" of 12 IS journals, our results showed that, of IS researchers who had published at least three papers in these journals, approximately 17% were women - a figure that is slightly less than the 21% of women IS faculty that we estimated. We also found that women comprised 13 of the Top 76 IS researchers for the period 1999-2003 (17%), and 42 of the top 251 IS scholars with three of more publications in these journals (16.7% women). Our study raises several implications for how to assess whether women have achieved equity in the IS academic field."
Information technology education and employment for women in Kenya,Lynette Kvasny,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125202,"Sub-Saharan Africa women have historically assumed the roles of housewife and subsistence farmer. However, with the global growth of information and communications technologies (ICT) and digital divide interventions, women are enrolling in university programs which prepare them for employment in the formal workforce. In this paper, we present a study in which we interviewed 32 women enrolled in an ICT program at a Kenyan university. The interviews examined the women's responses to the program as well as the women's experiences in seeking and securing ICT-related employment. Our findings indicate that women were highly optimistic, embracing ICT as a practical mechanism for achieving entrÃ©e into the labor force and empowering women. However they perceive significant structural barriers, such as gender discrimination in hiring practices, organization's inability to recognize their mix of technical and business competencies, and national ICT policies which did not support the growth in the technology sector."
Examining the role of general and firm-specific human capital in predicting IT professionals' turnover behaviors,Damien Joseph,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125204,"This study examines the effects of general and firm-specific human capital on IT professionals' turnover behaviors. In doing so, we make two contributions to IT research. First, we examine actual turnover behaviors rather than turnover intentions. Second, we go beyond prior IT turnover research to hypothesize and test a curvilinear relationship between human capital predictors and turnover behavior. Using survival analysis, we analyze archival work history data and find that the likelihood of turnover is reduced when IT professionals accumulate firm specific human capital. However, the likelihood of turnover increases with higher levels of general IT human capital. We conclude by discussing the results, suggesting possible areas for future research and noting the implications for practice."
Antecedents of turnover intention and actual turnover among information systems personnel in South Africa,D. C. Smith,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125205,"This study investigates Information Systems (IS) personnel turnover in South Africa. The results indicate that there is significant positive correlation between job satisfaction, career satisfaction and organisational commitment, whereby individuals experiencing job satisfaction are more likely to be committed to their organisation and experience career satisfaction. In addition, job satisfaction, career satisfaction and organisational commitment were all found to be negatively related to turnover intention. Based on these findings it is clear that organisations seeking a reduction in IS personnel turnover should consider the individual wants of employees and facilitate more appropriate matches between employees and jobs."

Effective training: applying frameworks to practice,Maung K. Sein,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125208,"Taking an integrated view of end-user training is an increasing trend in the IS literature. A number of conceptual frameworks have been proposed in the recent years. Yet, few have been evaluated empirically or put into practice. In this paper, we report how we evaluated one such framework while simultaneously evaluating the training strategy in an organization. This paper complements an earlier evaluation of another aspect of the same framework. As in the previous paper, we conclude that the framework is useful to evaluate organizational training efforts. At the same time, we discover shortcomings of the framework itself. We discuss these deficiencies and propose how the framework can be improved."

They can be uniquely successful in understanding what will directly influence the decisions of the business leadership team.The information technology organization recognizes that it must allow the auditors, outsourcers, and business implementers the flexibility to use innovative, streamlined best practices when applicable throughout the preparation for the Sarbanes-Oxley assessment. The success of any effort is largely dependent upon how well it is organized."
Understanding the job requirements for collaboration technology support through a hybrid IT-end user job classification model: the case of collaboration engineering and facilitation,Gwendolyn L. Kolfschoten,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125211,"Group Support Systems (GSS) refers broadly to supporting electronically mediated face-to-face and distributed teams throughout organizations performing a wide range of tasks. While the value of GSS has been shown in numerous field studies, their adoption and diffusion remains limited. One explanation for the limited dispersion of these systems is the difficulty faced by facilitators who lead and manage the technology, processes, and people involved with these tasks. Successfully fulfilling the roles of facilitation is complex and difficult. In this study we present a general IT-end user job classification model that we use to examine the various roles that facilitators typically play and discuss these in terms of the skills needed for their performance. We use the model to compare the 'traditional view' on GSS facilitation with that of Collaboration Engineering that proposes different skill sets to overcome organizational dependence on dedicated facilitators in GSS contexts."

The measurement of information system use: preliminary considerations,Michael J. Cuellar,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125214,"The concept of system use has suffered from a ""too simplistic definition"" (DeLone and McLean [9], p. 16). This paper reviews various attempts at conceptualization and measurement of system use and then proposes a re-conceptualization of it as ""the level of incorporation of an information system within a user's processes."" We then go on to develop the concept of a Functional Interface Point and four dimensions of system usage: automation level, the proportion of the business process encoded by the information system; extent, the proportion of the FIPs used by the business process; frequency, the rate at which FIPs are used by the participants in the process; and thoroughness, the level of use of information/functionality provided by the system at an FIP. The article concludes with a discussion of some implications of this re-conceptualization and areas for follow on research."
Factors influencing intentions to maintain web content in voluntary organizations,Kieran Mathieson,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125215,"Voluntary organizations (VOs) use Web sites to help them raise funds, recruit volunteers, and so on.

The results could help software designers make CMS use more attractive, and VO leaders find people willing to maintain content."
"End-user training methods: what we know, need to know",Saurabh Gupta,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125217,"End-User Training (EUT) has enjoyed a rich tradition of research in Information Systems. However, with the growing pace of change in technology and the dynamic nature of business, organizations are spending an increasing amount of money on end-user training. Training methods are also changing with little research to support new approaches. Thus, extensive research is required in the future. To be credible, end-user training research should preserve and build upon the significant literature that exists, both in IS and Education. This paper provides a review of EUT literature focusing on training methods. It summarizes the findings, while pointing out key future research issues."
How robust is the UTAUT instrument?: a multigroup invariance analysis in the context of acceptance and use of online community weblog systems,Jessica Pu Li,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125218,"The recent Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model developed by Venkatesh et al. (Venkatesh, et al., 2003) as an integration of the various technology acceptance and use models is an important model in IS literature. However, the UTAUT instrument has not been tested in many different settings and contexts yet. If the scales for the UTAUT constructs are not robust and stable across settings, they are most likely to effect the interpretation of research results. It is, therefore, essential to assess whether these scales are perceived in the same way by individuals in different subgroups. In this paper, acceptance of online community Weblog systems is chosen as the context and data collected from 265 business school undergraduate students are analyzed using multiple group invariance analysis to assess the equivalence of the UTAUT scales across different subgroups based on gender, general computing knowledge, Weblog-specific knowledge, experience with Weblogs, and frequency of using Weblogs. Results indicate that scales for the four constructs in UTAUT including performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions have invariant true scores across most but not all subgroups. Researchers and practitioners, therefore, need to apply caution when interpreting the results from the UTAUT instrument."
The importance of objectives and strategic lagging and leading indicators in the chain import and export process using the fuzzy logic system,Adolfo Alberto Vanti,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125220,"The Brazilian Industry's profile has suffered several changes along the years upon going through many economic stagnation processes to an actual growth process. Brazil has opened its borders for the international market and consequently has increased competitiveness, productivity and the innovation capacity. Through all these changes, the Brazilian companies are getting a more flexible management, and in terms of strategic planning, the companies need to get more flexible tools to help in the decision making process. In this work, the importance of the definition of objectives and strategic lagging and leading indicators in the chain import and export process in the light of strategic planning through the use of Fuzzy Logic System is presented. The referring system is mathematically detailed in Espin and Vanti (2005) and Espin; Becker and Vanti (2005). The system has been applied in a company active in the import and export segment, which is located in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil for 48 years. Therefore, the question is: What's the order of importance of lagging and leading indicators and objectives in the chains import and export process."

The internal career: an explorative study of the career anchors of information technology workers in Nigeria,Afam Ituma,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125222,"The interest of career scholars in exploring individual careers has not been matched by equivalent attention on the influence of national context on careers. This paper describes the findings of a qualitative study, which explored the career anchors of information technology workers in a relatively neglected area in the literature-Nigeria. The result of this study suggest that IT workers in Nigeria exhibit six different career anchors namely being stable, being marketable, being in-charge, being free, being balanced and being challenged. The key conclusion is that beyond the individual career interest, individual career actions and decision are shaped and constrained by the wider societal factors embedded in the context in which careers are enacted."
Systems architect and systems analyst: are these comparable roles?,Jack Downey,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125224,"The aim of this paper is to define the role of the 'systems architect' in the Irish telecommunications software sector and to compare it with Misic's definition of a 'systems analyst' in the information systems arena. The architect definition is based on in-depth interviews with practicing architects. The interview instrument is informed by social cognitive theory and the interviews were analyzed using the method of triples. The conclusion is that there are noticeable similarities between the roles, suggesting that the Irish telecommunications software sector can benefit from the computer personnel research carried out in the information systems field."
Information technology architects: approaching the longer view,Keith Frampton,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125225,"All Information Technology (IT) systems have architecture and these architectures are developed by people, frequently called IT architects. These people vary in their capabilities and this directly affects the systems they work with. This research investigates whether some previously identified capabilities, (intuitive cognitive style, problem solving, visualisation, and future vision) differ between IT architects of different skill levels. We found that while all IT architects reported as very skilled problem solvers, the more highly skilled IT architects approached problems in a different manner than the others. We also found that the higher skilled IT architects had a significantly longer view of their actions. These results are important for the education of aspiring IT architects and also the selection and development of existing ones."
Using volunteers for IT work: research questions,Kieran Mathieson,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125226,"Voluntary organizations (VOs) offer important services the private and public sectors cannot or will not provide. Unfortunately, VOs tend not to use information technology (IT) to the extent they could, and so don't receive the benefits IT offers. One problem is that many VOs must rely on volunteers for IT support. This paper examines the challenges using IT volunteers creates, including limits in availability, expertise, commitment, organizational knowledge, and equipment ownership. A framework for discussing the effectiveness of IT volunteers is presented. Research questions arising from the framework are identified."
Assessment of employees' perceptions of service quality and satisfaction with e-business,Jung-Yu Lai,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125228,"In the competitive environments of frequent and rapid changes, electronic business (e-business), whose supply, production, and logistics and distribution networks are enabled digitally, is increasingly dependent on electronic interconnections that are innovative in their functionality. Conceivably, its ability to deliver functions and services is closely associated with and helpful for the completion of employees' tasks and jobs, leading to service quality being critically important for the employees and e-business. On the other hand, since e-business utilizes enterprise applications, user satisfaction, as a surrogate measure of information system or information technology (IS/IT) effectiveness/success, is important for enterprise applications success. Thus, this research attempts to extrapolate the results of marketing research about customers' perceptions of service quality and IS/IT research about employees' perceptions of service quality to e-business. First, we revise and refine SERVQUAL instrument to fit in context of e-business and measure employees' perceived service quality with e-business. Based on a survey of 161 respondents practicing mostly in seven international electronic businesses in Taiwan, a 13-item EB-SERVQUAL instrument is proposed and can be used to improve and diagnose service quality with e-business. Second, we examine the causal relationship between service quality and user satisfaction. The instrument and our findings in this paper would be valuable to researchers and practitioners interested in designing, implementing, and managing e-business."
Exploring the effects of dependability on enterprise applications success in e-business,Jung-Yu Lai,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125229,"Electronic business (e-business) plays a major role in the modern economic network due to shorter cycle time and faster information transactions. Building enterprise applications that can coordinate activities, decisions, and knowledge cross many functions is a good solution for e-business. Hence, how to implement enterprise applications successfully has become an increasingly important management issue. Although information systems (IS) success has received fairly extensive attention from prior research, issues regarding whether service delivered by systems can be justifiably relied by users are seriously ignored, especially for complex systems like enterprise applications. Thus, this paper attempts to extend this kind of concept, dependability, into the DeLone & McLean's IS success model for exploring how it influences enterprise applications success. Results from a survey of 170 respondents taken from six international e-businesses in Taiwan strongly support that dependability is indeed an important factor for enterprise applications success. Additionally, over and beyond the effects of dependability on enterprise applications success, it can help practitioners and managers get deep insights about how to implement e-business successfully."
"Internet opt-in and opt-out: investigating the roles of frames, defaults and privacy concerns",Yee-Lin Lai,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125230,"This paper studies the solicitation process of consumers' consent - should consumers be requested to explicitly disapprove the use of their personal data (opt-out), or to acknowledge and permit the use of such data (opt-in)? Although these two actions may serve the same functional purpose (i.e., grant approval to the use of the supplied information), various regulatory and industry bodies have exhibited opposing attitudes towards them. The European Union Data Directive (1995) endorses the opt-in approach, whereas the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) recommends an opt-out procedure for consumers to remove their data from future uses. The two approaches can be operationalized via different option frames and preference elicitations. We illustrate how different permutation of frames and default preferences can affect the level of consumer participation and investigate the moderating role of privacy concern on these corollaries."
Preliminary insights into the in-group/out-group effect in partially distributed teams: an analysis of participant reflections,Haiyan Huang,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125232,"This paper explores issues related to the effectiveness of partially-distributed teams. In each of 12 student teams within a major university, the majority of team members were collocated at the main campus, while the remaining members were located at either one or two branch campuses. Teams worked on a semester long project for a leading Internet Entertainment subsidiary of a Fortune 100 company. One of the unique challenges of partially distributed teams is the in-group/out-group effect that is associated with geographical distance. A preliminary qualitative analysis of team member weekly reflections reveals that two other faultlines, namely the power faultline and information flow faultline, existed in parallel with the geographic faultline, and served to widen the ""us vs. them"" split. However, the degree of in-group/out-group varied across teams. Three factors -- work ethic, work quality, and media mix -- moderated the team interaction process to alter the level of conflict and trust and the resulting degree of in-group/out-group effect experienced by partially distributed teams.

Many factors influence the way that teams can successfully accomplish their objectives. One of these influences is the personality of the individual team members. This report explores some of the relationships between personality and information technology (IT) team issues and outcomes. A pilot study of university students reviews the role of personality in two major areas - team processes and overall success of the team project. A simplified classification based on MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) is used to categorize personality types. One of the dependent variables is success on team projects as measured by the team outcome. In addition, a comprehensive construct measuring team processes is studied. A third area studied is the personality diversity within a team. Preliminary findings and relationships from the study are reviewed."
Outsourcing relationship literature: an examination and implications for future research,Albert Sargent,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125234,Dibbern et al. [4] performed a comprehensive survey of the existing outsourcing literature from 1988 to 2000. Their research identified research topics in IT outsourcing that had yet to be explored or exhausted. The customer and vendor relationship was identified as an area that presented researchers with an opportunity to expand the outsourcing research that had already been created.This paper extends Dibbern et al.'s [4] research by examining the existing outsourcing relationship literature and identifies areas of opportunity for study.
Which information technology major is right for me?: a preliminary finding,Pruthikrai Mahatanankoon,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125236,"Students interested in an IT career understand little about the actual knowledge and critical skills required by each of the information technology majors (i.e., computer science, information systems, and telecommunications management). Existing psychometric career orientation measurements can be used to assist students in their selections of different IT majors. The preliminary analysis suggests that a discriminant function can be used to classify student groups and assist them in making wiser career decisions. By understanding the students' career orientations and assisting them with the selection of a major, we can ultimately increase their motivation to pursue IT careers."
Internships and occupational commitment of college students in IT-related majors,Jeffrey Stanton,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125237,"We conducted two linked studies of students in IT-related majors who were recently or currently involved in some type of pre-professional work activity such as an internship. In the first study, we interviewed students to obtain their impressions of the occupational subculture of IT. Verbatims from interviews with the students, along with tallies of the categories of their responses, suggested that pre-professional experiences had given these students a realistic preview of IT occupational subculture. In the second study, we transformed the impressions we had received from the student interviews into a set of evaluative dimensions relevant to the characteristics of IT occupational subculture. We devised survey items to assess these evaluative dimensions, and then administered the survey to N=211 students to see if any differences existed among students grouped by gender or ethnicity. Finally, we used our measures of these evaluative dimensions to predict an outcome variable relevant to persistence in IT, namely occupational commitment. Some differences did arise among different groups of students, and some of the evaluative dimensions were useful in predicting occupational commitment."
A method combining email and web pages for announcing research opportunities to researchers,David Chodos,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125238,"This paper presents a model for disseminating information about research opportunities at a university that goes beyond the standard sending of lengthy email messages to large numbers of recipients. We advocate instead a system which uses brief email messages with pointers to webpages offering additional detail, a searchable database of announcements, more carefully targeted recipient lists and blending push and pull to distribute information. We discuss our experience engaging end users of this system at our university and, finally, comment on the value of the design as a general mechanism for achieving effective communication within any organization."
Why IS: understanding the factors influencing undergraduate students' intention to choose IS major in business,Wei Zhang,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125240,"Over the last a few years, undergraduate students seem increasingly less enthusiasm about IS major, and the enrollments to IS major in business schools, especially in the U.S. business schools, have been suffering. The continuing losses in IS enrollments have generated a widespread concern among IS professors, school administrators, and practitioners. Despite many speculations on what led to the down turn, there has been surprisingly little research that systematically investigates this issue. In this paper, I propose to use the theory of reasoned action (TRA) to understand students' intention to choose IS major. Factors that could influence students' choices are identified from previous research and categorized according to the theoretical framework offered by TRA. Hopefully, the insights generated from the study can help design new recruiting strategies to turn around the situation."
Podcasting in academia: a new knowledge management paradigm within academic settings,Peter Ractham,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125241,"Podcasting represents a new and exciting learning paradigm within an academic setting. Materials such conference reports, research manuscripts, and course lectures can be recorded as audio and video files and delivered to subscribing users automatically. A minimum skills and effort is requiring for involved parties to accomplish the knowledge transaction. The ease of use and seamless transaction between users enable more efficiency in resource consumption. Minimal time and effort is wasted for both knowledge distribution and acquisition. In addition, podcasting can be utilized in various types of knowledge management practices including, a collaborative and social networking activities. This paper provides a technological overview of podcasting, and examines the potential podcasting usage within educational settings, podcasting contributions to academia, and future podcasting research suggestions."
"Virtual vs. face-to-face teams: deadbeats, deserters, and other considerations",Emmeline de Pillis,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125243,"201 participants were randomly assigned to complete an intellective task in either virtual or face-to-face three-person teams. Virtual teams displayed lower average performance, less cohesion and satisfaction, more time spent on the task, and more ""deadbeats"" or free-riders than face-to-face teams. Among the virtual teams there were also two ""deserters,"" individuals who openly abandoned the group. These findings indicate that virtual work design should only be selected over face-to-face work if cost savings are sufficient to justify the probable reductions in efficiency, morale, and performance.Average grade performance of female participants was 3.9% higher than that of male participants in the virtual teams, but only 0.9% higher than that of male participants in the face-to-face teams. In both conditions, males were more likely to be deadbeats than were females. The highest likelihood of being a deadbeat was among males in the virtual teams: 10.4% of them were reported as deadbeats by both team members. 7.3% of females in virtual teams and 3.6% of males in face-to-face teams were reported as deadbeats by both team members. There were no reports of female deadbeats in the face-to-face teams. Both of the deserters in the study were also males in virtual teams. The greater gap between male and female performance in the virtual teams, together with the incidence of free riding among males in the virtual teams, may indicate that virtual work might be an especially poor fit for the skills or working styles of at least some males."
Affective commitment in the public sector: the case of IT employees,Margaret F. Reid,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125244,"To improve our understanding of individual motivations to remain employed in governmental agencies this study focuses on a specific segment of a state government agency workforce. Information technology (IT) employees possess skills that transfer easily to other sectors, which make them an important group when examining factors that influence the affective commitment and job satisfaction of individuals working in public agencies. Findings indicate that role ambiguity, perceived organizational support, leader member exchange, and task variety are the independent variables that explain most of the variance in affective public sector commitment and job satisfaction."

Finally, in the workshop portion of the session, we present two ideas for research that stem from SOX activity in IT organizations and open the floor for additional ideas and discussion."
Career anchors and organizational culture: a study of women in the IT workforce,Jeria L. Quesenberry,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125249,"Despite the shortage of information technology (IT) professionals and the benefits of human diversity in the global economy women are largely under represented in the IT workforce. Prior employment research on gender stratification demonstrates that this under representation is a reflection of organizational and social structures, rather than essentialist generalizations about gender group characteristics. As a result, it is necessary to understand the characteristics of the IT workforce, and in particular, the opportunities and constraints that influence career choice and retention in the profession. Therefore, this study aims to empirically investigate how career satisfaction and turnover intention of females in the U.S. IT workforce are a function of individual career anchors (or self-perceived values and career motives) and organizational culture. In doing so, this study employs a qualitative methodological approach comprised of three phases. The primary objective of this study is to inform research and practice through the articulation of the ways in which career anchors and organizational culture shape American women's perception of and retention in IT careers.Jeria Quesenberry is a fourth year doctoral candidate in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at the Pennsylvania State University.

A comprehensive model for understanding technology selection decisions of interconnected information technologies,Justin Cochran,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125250,"Information technologies are becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent, which enhances functionalities and communications, but also introduces new risks and considerations such as technical incompatibilities, technology mortality, switching costs, and lock-in. This research aims to build on innovation diffusion theory and network effects theory by introducing switching costs theory to construct a more comprehensive framework explaining technology selection decisions. Additionally, the research model has been informed and tweaked based on several interviews with technology selectors, and the resulting model will be empirically verified. From this research, practitioners can better understand the factors that make a difference in success and failure of technology decisions, and consequently, develop strategies to mitigate the risks which accompany selection decisions. For researchers, this research will provide empirical verification of a range of existing theories when their relationships are examined together.Justin Cochran is a doctoral candidate in Management Information Systems at the University of Georgia.

The effects of user participation in identifying information security risk in business processes,Janine L. Spears,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125252,"User participation is essential to identifying information security risks in routine business processes because it is the business users who possess detailed knowledge of business processes. This research develops a theory of the consultative form of user participation that emphasizes the cognitive benefits of user participation. In consultative participation, designated users acting as subject matter experts with detailed knowledge of specific business processes participate in a risk analysis to identify information security vulnerabilities. It is expected that previously unknown information risks will be identified, thereby increasing the quality of information used for information risk management. Knowledge of identified risks is expected to be transferred among peers (e.g., other users) or other participant groups (e.g., IT), which is expected to ultimately lead to improved information security through enhanced policies and procedures."
Comparative IT education: a national economic development approach,Edgar A. Maldonado,"April 2006,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1125170.1125253,"Edgar Maldonado is a second year graduate student in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State. His advisor is Dr. Andrea Tapia. He expects to graduate in 2008.The trends of the new economy that sustains the process of globalization have placed Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in an important position within the overall of topics in education systems across the world. Governments design education policies to develop more and better information technology (IT) practitioners and researchers to follow the example of those countries that have successfully jumped into the globalization wagon and speeded the development of their economy. However this idea is hardly arguable, the planning of the formation of those professionals must be considered. The adoption and use of technology does not occur in the same way in different circumstances, so the plan of the education of ICT must take into account the specific situation of each country. Economy is the first factor of the list, but sociological and political factors cannot be left out of consideration. This study propose a framework to analyze the impact of economy in IT professional-oriented educational policies and vice versa. The purpose of the research is to explain how different countries use different approaches to train of IT professionals, and to understand the uniqueness of this process."
"Who is ""the IT workforce""?: challenges facing policy makers, educators, management, and research",Michelle L. Kaarst-Brown,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055975,"Despite over six decades of research on the role and definition of the IT workforce, there remain numerous, and often contradictory, definitions related to the identity of this group. The IT workforce is made up of IT professionals, computer scientists, software developers, and business professionals trained in MIS, as well as various occupational sub-categories in organizations including programmer, analyst, network specialist, and project manager, to name only a few. Despite this, some researchers, funding organizations, and practitioners refer to the ""IT workforce"" as if this term represents a homogeneous group of individuals that is clearly defined and understood. Our findings contradict this assumption, and raise a number of challenges for management, researchers, policy makers, educators, and funding agencies. We argue that a clear definition of the IT workforce would assist at all levels, and might bring some additional clarity to training, hiring, and retention issues."
Building theory about IT professionals: is a taxonomy or typology the answer?,Thomas R. Shaw,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055976,"A major barrier to our ability to integrate studies and build cumulative theory about IT jobs and IT workers is the lack of consistency in terminology and conceptualizations of the profession, the jobs within the profession and the salient characteristics of those jobs. The purpose of this research is to examine how two different approaches - an IT jobs taxonomy or IT jobs typology - could be used to provide a standard framework to address this issue. The paper includes illustrations of the problem and overviews of the two approaches."
Assessing the IT training and development climate: an application of the Q-methodology,Stephen C. Wingreen,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055977,"The Q-methodology was employed to address the managerial problem of deciding which of the firm's personnel development resources should be aimed at which personnel, or groups of personnel, through the various venues of development that are available to the firm for the development of its IT workforce. The procedure identified six interpretable groups of IT professionals that seem to be associated with the development priorities of the IT management, analytical, development & programming, and operations functions. Opportunities are identified for both future research and the practical application of the Q-methodology, its associated instrumentation, and analytical procedure as a managerial decision tool in the context of the internal development of the firm's IT personnel to meet the firm's goals."
The influence of environmental context on women in the IT workforce,Eileen M. Trauth,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055979,"In an effort to better understand the under representation of women in the IT field, the focus of research has been on the collection and analysis of empirical data. However, there is also a need for appropriate theory to understand and explain that data. Toward this end, Trauth has engaged in a program of research directed at the articulation of an empirically-grounded theory to explain and predict the under representation of women in the IT field. Called The Individual Differences Theory of Gender and IT, this theory argues that the under representation of women in IT is better accounted for by understanding the variation across women than by focusing on ascribed differences between men and women in stereotype. To this end, a set of constructs has been identified, including: personal data, shaping and influencing factors and environmental context. This set of constructs is being used as the interpretive vehicle in a multi-year study of the life histories of women IT professionals. The results, to date, have addressed the personal data, and shaping and influencing factors. The purpose of this paper is to examine the construct: environmental context. The results suggest that economic factors such as size of the information economy, household income and cost of living, and cultural factors such as attitudes and values regarding women, women working and women working in IT do exert an influence on the experience of women in the IT workforce. Thus, the data analysis presented in this paper serves to further supports this emerging theory of individual differences of gender and IT and its constructs."
Examining the masculinity and femininity of critical attributes necessary to succeed in IT,K. D. Joshi,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055980,"Some research findings show that women are even more likely than men to leave the information technology (IT) field and gender segregation in the types of jobs held within the broad field of IT is marked, with women especially rare in the higher paid job categories. Therefore, this study examines whether the gender segregation and turnover of women in IT, in part, shaped by the perception that the desired characteristics of IT workers that are necessary to be successful in IT occupations fit men more so than women. Research is being conducted at two organizations: a large international consulting firm and a Fortune 500 information technology company, limited to IT employees and stakeholders in the Northwest. This study is being conducted in two phases. The first phase activities involve focus group sessions and interviews at the participating organizations. In the second phase, a web-based company-specific survey will be developed and administered to a large sample of employees and stakeholders in each organization."
Opportunities for women in IT security,Martha Myers,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055981,"Much prior research has examined the dearth of women in the IT industry. The purpose of this study is to examine the questions surrounding women in IT within the context of Information Security and Assurance. This research-in-progress report describes results from one phase in a study of a relatively new career path to see if there are female-friendly opportunities that have not existed in previous IT career paths. Research methodology focuses on a qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with women who are self-described IT security professionals. The next phase will focus on interviews with men in the IT security field as a basis for comparison. A primary goal of the study is to determine whether or not women in security face the same challenges and opportunities as they do in other IT fields. Further, does the security area offer equivalent opportunities for women and men? Finally, implications are explored, including those for IT educators in terms of recruiting and retaining diverse groups of students to pursue security related careers."
When models cross the border: adapting IT competencies of business managers,Marius Duedahl,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055983,"Much of the moving beyond the bust to boom has been fuelled by the increasing internationalization of organizations. More and more businesses are becoming global in nature with several US-based firms establishing subsidiaries or partners in other countries. At the same time, information technology (IT) is becoming more ubiquitous and an integral part of business processes. As organizations become increasingly more dependent on IT to survive in competitive environments, the need increases for IT competent business managers. The intersection of these two trends leads to a vital question: how can we use concepts and guidelines related to assessing the IT-competence of business managers that are developed in one country to the context of another country In this paper, we examine this issue by adapting a model of IT competence developed and validated in Canada to the Norwegian context. Using a multi-method approach based on interviews conducted in several organizations, and a questionnaire survey, we made several changes to the model."
A knowledge-centric framework for process redesign,Kelly J. Fadel,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055984,"Research in the area of business process redesign has traditionally focused on performance metrics for measuring process change. However, from the perspective of an employee performing the business process, such measurements are inadequate because they fail to account for the knowledge change required for the employee to perform the new process. This paper explores process redesign from a knowledge perspective. We introduce the concept of a knowledge gap when a process is redesigned and, using theories of learning transfer, identify several process knowledge elements. A framework incorporating these knowledge elements can be used to assess knowledge change during process redesign. We illustrate the use of this framework in a case study, the process redesign at Campus Health department of a large public university."
DIY-IT: an empirical study of website development staffing by non-profit organizations,Susan A. Vowels,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055985,"Scholars have extensively examined the role of information technology workers through the prism of the corporate world, a viewpoint open to bias tending toward constructs that deal exclusively with professional IT workers. The purpose of this study is to investigate a significant area that has been under explored, namely, the use of non-traditional or ""do-it-yourself IT"" workers, and to explore the possibility that with the advent of more user-friendly and ubiquitous IT productivity tools, the use of non-professional IT staff, or ""DIY-IT,"" is becoming an attractive and viable option, particularly for non-profit organizations and small businesses. This study will examine the impact of web design software products and cost-effective hosting solutions on website development and website maintenance staffing by non-profit arts organizations and by small businesses. A hypothesis is that in the non-profit world, DIY-IT is performed by volunteers and by paid employees who are not primarily IT workers and whose primary job descriptions focuses on broader tasks. In small businesses, it is hypothesized that DIY-IT is performed by staff who are not primarily IT workers. The extent of DIY-IT is of interest, as well as its impact, i.e., are organizations more satisfied with their websites when professional IT personnel are involved, how does the degree of sophistication vary as a function of the type of IT staffing, can the value of professional IT personnel be quantified, and are there circumstances when DIY-IT is more appropriate in fulfilling the needs of the organization? As this research progresses, a goal is to develop a model that can be generally applied to IT staffing by non-profit organizations and small businesses."
"Alternative employment arrangements contribute to organizational citizenship and innovative work, or not: information technology professional's psychological contract will tell",Sandra K. Newton,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1056000,"Management of information technology (IT) human capital is more dynamic and diverse today as organizations use a variety and mixture of employment arrangements to gain IT core competency, cost, and productivity improvements, yet it is not well known how the employment arrangements affect the IT professional. Applying the psychological contract framework and social information processing theory in the investigation into the IT professional's psychological contract and the affects of their employment arrangement will bring improved understanding of their subsequent attitudes and behaviors. This study will obtain cross-sectional data from IT professionals, which is especially relevant as alternative employment strategies continue to be the trend. Goals toward organizational effectiveness can be implemented through the use of varied employment arrangements; however, ensuring the goals succeed requires new understanding of how the varied employment arrangements affect the psychological contracts of IT professionals. The anticipated findings will provide human resource managers the knowledge necessary to implement strategies toward improved psychological contracts to facilitate continued organizational citizenship and innovative work. This study extends current research on alternative employment arrangements by considering the important factors, such as psychological contracts, organizational citizenship behavior and innovative work behavior in the context of IT professionals."
The other side of turnover: managing IT personnel strategically,Havard Meland,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1056001,"Turnover has always been regarded as dysfunctional for organizations especially in the IT industry. Research and practice has focused on retaining IT professionals. IT companies have made efforts to retain their workers by increasing salaries, fringe benefits and in general, create an environment attractive for high performing knowledge workers. In this paper, we present a different perspective and argue that turnover is a possible strategic facilitator for organizational development. Using theory of planned behavior, theory of psychological contracts and building upon prior research in IT turnover, we propose a model which we call Strategic Turnover Management Process (STMP). In developing our model, we supplemented the theoretical and empirical premises with data gathered from an internationally known IT consulting company. The model has three stages - assessing employees' intentions, deciding on intervention measures, and enacting actual intervention. We propose ways of implementing our model and conclude by stressing that preventing turnover should not be the goal of any organization, but rather be accepted as a natural part of the market dynamics. Organizations should not try to stop the water from flowing downstream, but aim to control its speed and direction."
Career orientation and organizational commitment of IT personnel,Mary Sumner,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1056002,"The management of information technology (IT) personnel poses unique challenges, but managers may be able to provide IT professionals with appropriate opportunities and career paths by matching individual expectations with job characteristics. This study is designed to identify the career anchors possessed by current IT personnel and to identify which career anchors are the strongest determinants of organizational commitment. Results from a pilot study identified four career anchors or orientations prevalent in IT personnel: Creativity, Autonomy, Identity, and Variety. Responses from sixty-six IT professionals were analyzed; and a weighted variation of Time in Job, Variety, Autonomy, and Identity explained 38% of the variation in Organizational Commitment."
Redesigning human resources for IT: meeting organizational needs in a changing environment,Diane Bandow,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055990,
Lessons from Darwin: adaptation and career management for IT professionals,Diane Bandow,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055992,"Darwin introduced the world to his theory on environmental change in the adaptation of different species; although his book originally appeared in 1842, the concepts are still relevant to provide a lens through which IT career management can be examined. Key terms in nature such as environmental change and evolution are also applicable and exist in the business environment and organizations today. In business as in nature, environmental changes influence opportunities and modification occurs to meet different needs. Just as organizations have evolved from the elaborate and complex hierarchies to new organizational forms such as matrix, virtual, and flat, the individuals working in these organizations have also had to change with the organizations. The business environment has evolved from one of predictability and long-term planning to one of rapid changes, unpredictability and global competition. One key area in need of modification is career management; current views on career management are based on old organizational concepts and models that are inappropriate for the current, rapidly changing environment. To meet these changes, Cheseborough & Davis (1983) recommended that IT professionals assume responsibility for their own careers. Many other research efforts since then have made the same recommendation, but there is little research and limited information to indicate if personal career management ever really occurred or to what extent.Traditional career management was previously accomplished between individuals and organizations through slow but deliberate progression and career ladders, and individuals relied on supervisors, experience and the passage of time for promotion. The business environment has radically changed; organizations rarely support traditional career ladders; the dual ladders in IT have provided less than stellar outcomes (Allen & Katz, 1986)."

Identifying the prototypical career paths of IT professionals: a sequence and cluster analysis,Damien Joseph,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055994,"This study seeks to understand whether there are prototypical career paths in IT. We use sequence analysis to analyze actual work history of individuals who had held jobs in the IT profession. Our findings suggest that, contrary to the traditional view of a dual career path of IT professionals, IT professionals' careers actually follow one of three career paths: technical; managerial; or protean. We also find that individuals in the IT technical career path have significantly more IT technical experience compared to those in other career paths. We conclude this paper by discussing these results and identifying the implications for research and practice. This study makes a key contribution to the literature on IT professionals as being one of the first to analyze empirically the actual career paths of IT."
Company investments in home-PCs: realising business value through human resource development?,Tom Roar Eikebrokk,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055996,"In Europe, companies are increasing their investments in home-PCs to employees for use at home. These investments are stimulated by tax regulations mainly driven by the assumption that these investments increase IT competence and competitiveness. However, there are few empirical studies that have analysed these assumptions. This paper contributes with empirical data to the relationship between the management of home-PC arrangements and business value. The relationship between home-PC investments, financial-, training- and support strategies, and business value is explored with interview data from 8 Norwegian companies, consultants and technology providers followed by an empirical survey in 69 companies. The main results suggest that home-PCs stimulate knowledge creation, but also that tax regulation can be counterproductive. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research. The results have implications for business and government leaders globally, as they make policy decisions regarding the implementation of programs that stimulate the adoption of home-PCs that are intended to stimulate IT competence."
Privacy policies of the largest privately held companies: a review and analysis of the forbes private 50,Alan R. Peslak,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055997,"This study reviews the Internet privacy policies of the 50 largest privately held companies in the US as identified by Forbes magazine. The study builds on work of prior researchers who analyzed popular and random e-commerce websites. In this study, the websites of privately held firms were reviewed and analyzed for the inclusion of the Federal Trade Commission's Fair Information Practices as well as a series of other consumer-centered factors. A comparison was also made between the policies of largest US publicly traded companies and the privately held companies. Overall the study finds that privately held companies do not demonstrate consistency in following Fair Information Practices or consumer-centered Internet policies. Also, the 50 largest privately held companies are generally less likely to publicly reveal their policies relative to Fair Information Practices or consumer-centered policies than the 50 largest publicly held companies. This is due to a large extent to lack of any privacy policies for many privately held companies. If only those companies with privacy policies are analyzed, two factors show significant differences between public and private company privacy policies."
Cyclic knowledge management system in e-governance: a case study of evaluating polls on referendum-independence of quebec using ANN,Manzur Ashraf,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055998,"E-Governance brings urban and rural together and breaks the barrier of distance to lead an efficient administration. Surprisingly, E-Governance have not made enough impact on the people as e-Commerce and e-Learning have done. From the software engineering point of view, E-Governance has a lot of characteristics, which are different from e-Commerce and e-Learning. It is enough for e-Commerce and e-Learning to be reactive whereas E-Governance needs to be proactive. While e-Commerce and e-Learning involve Information Management, E-Governance involves Knowledge Management (KM). Knowledge management is the management of information, skill, experience, innovation, and intelligence. Our model of E-Governance based on Knowledge Management System (KMS) is built on KM cycle of Knowledge capturing, Knowledge sharing, Knowledge enhancing, and Knowledge preserving. A few popular models of E-Governance use a concept of ""knowledge centers"" to share knowledge. Our model shares knowledge that supports the law of knowledge dynamics. The development model of E-Governance based on Information Management System (IMS) applies a cycle-based process such as spiral or iterative process. This paper studies a development model of KMS-based E-Governance, which is path-based. This model provides an environment where the system grows with the people. To simulate the proposed KMS model, we analyzed a scenario based on the poll on Referendum question of Quebec, CA regarding independence (unilateral action or negotiation) using Artificial Neural Network."
A framework to elicit the skills needed for software development,Jack Downey,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055987,"This paper proposes a theoretical framework to inform an interview instrument. This instrument will be used to investigate the skills needed in software development by interviewing experienced personnel. Based on Social Cognitive Theory, this framework will allow for the elicitation of skill-set information by considering the person, their behaviors and the organization they work in."
Staffing and management of e-commerce programs and projects,Fred Niederman,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1055988,"Electronic commerce (e-commerce) personnel are instrumental in developing and maintaining electronic commerce programs and projects within firms. In spite of the dot-com bust, the number of firms developing and using e-commerce for interactions with customers and suppliers is growing. Personnel competence as individuals and as a group can be a decisive force in determining the level of success of e-commerce projects. This paper used in-depth interviews toward creating a better understanding of broad concepts and values in this area. More specifically, it examines the management and staffing of e-commerce projects in terms of how work is organized, which organizational unit governs e-commerce programs and management, how staff are assigned to projects and what skills are critical, and how outcomes are measured. Significant variance was identified in each of these areas."
Effects of culture on control mechanisms in offshore outsourced IT projects,Ravi Narayanaswamy,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1056004,"In spite of the increasing trend of offshore outsourcing in the IT industry, there has been little attention given to control strategies for managing offshore IT development. This paper offers an analysis of the relationship between national culture and control mechanisms, which is particularly important in the offshore systems development context. Control is defined as an attempt made by an organization to ensure that individuals act according to an agreed upon strategy to achieve desired objectives. This paper uses four modes of control that have been previously applied to information systems development - formal (outcome, behavior) and informal (clan, self) - in the offshore context. The dimensions of national culture studied are based on Hofstede's work and include individualism (vs. collectivism), uncertainty avoidance, and power distance. The objective of this research is to address the effect of national cultural differences on control mechanisms. Propositions regarding the relationship between cultural dimensions and modes of control used in offshore-outsourced ISD project are presented. This work draws from three distinct research streams - control, outsourcing, and culture. This work proposes portfolios of control that contain a mix of control mechanisms which should be implemented depending on the cultural settings involved."
An empirical comparison of direct and indirect measures of person-organization (P-O) fit,Thomas W. Ferratt,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1056005,"Person-organization (P-O) fit is an important concept for understanding the attitudes and behavior of individuals in organizations, in general, and information technology (IT) professionals, in particular. The objective of this paper is to examine a controversial issue related to the measurement of P-O fit. We explain the controversy and empirically investigate it using a sample of IT professionals."
The move to outsourced IT projects: key risks from the provider perspective,Hazel Taylor,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1056006,"As the number of outsourced IT projects increases, the identification of risks that may impact during project implementation has become increasingly important. There has been extensive research into the risk factors that impact on IT projects, typically focusing on in-house development although, more recently, some researchers have investigated risks for out-sourced projects from the client perspective. The question of the risks involved from the perspective of the outsource provider, however, has received little attention, but is becoming increasingly important with the present trend to outsourced projects. The research reported here describes key risks identified by a group of Hong Kong project managers working for vendor IT firms who offered package implementation solutions both locally and overseas. A number of new risks from the vendor perspective have been identified, which indicate that vendor project managers typically have a broader focus on risks than their in-house counterparts. In addition to risks to the project success itself, vendor project managers must be constantly vigilant for threats to their own firms from competitors and from potential damage to their firm's reputation if the customer is dissatisfied with either the outcomes or the process of the project. The increasing trend towards multinational outsourced projects also adds additional location-specific risks that must be addressed. The findings are of interest to all managers involved in offshore outsourcing projects."
Lessons learned from organizing: 1995 -- 2004,Lorne Olfman,"April 2005,",https://doi.org/10.1145/1055973.1056008,"The main objective of this panel is to provide a forum for past conference chairs, program chairs, and others, to discuss lessons learned from organizing the past 10 SIGMIS-CPR conferences and how the lessons can make future conferences even more successful."
Knowledge impacts of user participation: a cognitive perspective,Jun He,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982374,"Although user participation has been studied over four decades, there are still many questions unanswered. This research identifies two gaps in this field: a lack of understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms that intervene with the information systems development (ISD) process, and a lack of understanding of knowledge structures between user participants and system developers that may shape the effectiveness of team processes. To fill up the two gaps, I propose a knowledge perspective of user participation and identify two types of knowledge interactions between user participants and system developers, knowledge acquisition and knowledge exploitation, as main team processes that mediate the relationship between user participation and team performance. In addition, I assimilate recent advances in the filed of collective cognition. Major implications of this study are that user participation may not be effective if participants cannot contribute knowledge to the ISD process, or their knowledge cannot be successfully acquired and utilized by the ISD project team; and team cognition, specified here as transactive memory systems and shared mental models, will shape the effects of knowledge interactions between users and system developers, thereby indirectly influencing the performance of the ISD project team. A theoretical model is also provided."
An agency theory model of ERP implementation,Vedabrata Basu,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982375,"Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are becoming rapidly indispensable in order for large and medium sized organizations to run their operations. Therefore, management needs to know the factors that drive successful ERP implementation, a product of the continuous interaction between the implementation consultants and client firms. Agency theory has been successfully used by different researchers to explain relationships between two parties seeking a common outcome. This paper develops a model of testable propositions for applying agency theory to study the relationship between implementation consultants and client organizations deploying the ERP systems, and to consequently evaluate how the relationship affects the implementation success."
Conceptual frameworks in practice: evaluating end-user training strategy in an organization,Maren Simonsen,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982376,"Rapid development in new information technology requires constant need for training end user. Organisations spend heavily on training, but do not take an integrative approach in formulating training strategies. This is mainly due to lack of guidance from the literature. A few frameworks that have been proposed have not been evaluated. In this paper, we use one such framework and use it to evaluate the training strategy in an organisation. This summative evaluation is followed by the formative evaluation of the framework itself. Based on our findings, we conclude that the framework is useful to evaluate organisational training efforts. However, we also point out deficiencies in the framework itself and suggest areas of improvement."
Employment arrangement fit for IT professionals: an examination of the importance of fit components,Thomas W. Ferratt,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982378,"A model of employment arrangement fit for IT professionals has been proposed by Enns, Ferratt, and Prasad (2002). An expanded version of that model used in this study includes eleven employment arrangement characteristics (e.g., job/income security). Consistent with the definition of fit based on needs and supplies (Kristof, 1996), fit is the degree to which the actual amount of a characteristic supplied by the employer is congruent with the IT professional's preferences (or needs). The major issue examined in this study is whether the relationship between fit and various outcome variables is moderated by the importance of the characteristics on which fit is assessed, as hypothesized by Kristof. Data have been collected from over 500 IT professionals. This research-in-progress will present the results of analyzing the data to examine the moderating effects of importance. Implications for theory, measurement, and analysis will be discussed."
Organizational survival and alignment: insights into conflicting perspectives on the role of the IT professional,Indira R. Guzman,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982379,"Different organizational theories clearly define critical organizational activities necessary for organizational survival. Recent attention to ""hybrid"" research that links organizational theory with MIS research has been proposed to lend new insights into strategic alignment of IT (Orlikowski & Barley, 2000; Zmud, 2002). One gap still to be addressed relates to role expectations and skills required by the IT professional according to different organizational theories. Much of the literature on strategic alignment of IT emphasizes the value provided by the IT artifact or focuses on communication between IT and business management, rather than on the role of IT professionals inferred by critical survival activities outlined in different organizational theories.Motivated by organizational concerns related to the clarity and articulation of the role of Information Technology professionals in contributing to strategic alignment, our study reviews literature about the role of the information technology professional and the differences according to three organizational theories: Agency theory, Transaction Cost theory and Institutional theory. We then use bibliometrics and content analysis to analyze published research for implicit or explicit skill expectations and contributions to organizational survival and strategic alignment of IT. The goal of our study is to contribute to a better understanding of role conflict, skill expectations, and value of information technology professionals in organizations, and also contribute to a consolidation between information systems research and organizational studies."
The impact of organizational ethical climate fit on information technology professional's job satisfaction and organizational commitment research in progress,Sandra K. Newton,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982380,"The recent wave of high profile corporate ethical failures, as well as ethical issues surrounding information technologies and users of those technologies, raises questions about the limits that an IT professional will tolerate and accept as normalized behavior. Consideration as to what is normalized behavior within the organizational ethical climate is an important aspect of corporate ethics, in that beliefs about the organizational ethical climate fit are theorized to have effects on both job satisfaction and organizational commitment. In order to account for both the situational and moral components of the individual's beliefs about the ethical climate, the study operationalizes the IT professional's ethical climate ""fit,"" the individual's beliefs about their ""fit"" with the organizational ethical climate. Social Cognitive Theory was used as a foundation for the research model. Development and refinement of the instrumentation was accomplished using expert evaluators and qualitative discussion groups. The instrument was administered to a small sample of undergraduate students, and the final phase of the pilot test (n = 63) was conducted to pre-validate the instrument and research model using path analysis procedure. The pilot test results appear to indicate that both the instrumentation and research model possess positive characteristics that support their pre-validation, and hence, their usefulness for subsequent research. These findings may represent an early assessment of an emerging awareness in corporate ethics, and therefore of considerable value both to researchers and practitioners. It is the intent of the authors to pursue this line of inquiry with a primary data collection effort to support an expanded research model."
An empirical test of the job demand/control model among IT users,Yide Shen,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982382,"By applying Karasek's Job Demand/Control model, this paper examines the antecedents, moderators and consequences of IT-related workplace stress. While the topic of stress continues to interest IS researchers, there has been a lack of a cumulative tradition, in terms of the specific theoretical frameworks used to understand the problem. Drawing on recent insights about the determinants of workplace stress, our research includes both work stress sources as well as employees' autonomy/ control over their work to anticipate the consequences of stress IT users experience in their work. We examine how users who are assimilating new IT into their work experience the level of work-related demands in their jobs, the level of autonomy/ control they have over their work, and how these relate to outcomes, such as job dissatisfaction and mental health complaints (i.e., symptoms of depression). Our results show that negative consequences are moderated by the amount of autonomy that employees experience in their work."
What is really important in supporting end-users?,Hallgeir Nilsen,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982383,"As end-user computing enters its third decade, the question of how best to provide support to the end users remains a vexing management challenge. In this paper, we address this issue. We use the problem definition phase of an action research project at an institution of higher learning in Norway to examine a variety of factors that are suggested in the literature to influence user satisfaction with end-user support. We also sought to gauge user preferences regarding support provider characteristics and location of support services. Our results provide interesting implications to organize user support."
Knowledge networking in global organizations: the transfer of knowledge,Eli Hustad,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982384,"This article focuses on how knowledge can be developed and transferred in multinational organizations, and how 'communities of knowing' can stimulate these knowledge processes through global collaboration supported by information and communication technology (ICT). Former IS research findings regarding virtual collaborative work across geographical and organizational boundaries are reviewed and discussed towards established knowledge and globalization theories. A description of knowledge management initiatives in the telecommunications corporation Ericsson exemplifies the implementation of an explicit knowledge networking strategy where different 'communities of knowing' are the point of effort concerning utilization of the knowledge potential in the entire organization. The analysis indicates that an inter-organizational context for the communities and cross-communities communication increase the complexity and difficulties for knowledge transfer and sharing mechanisms and collaboration."
Professional work and its impact on development of information and communication technology,Ann Johansson,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982386,"Information and communication technology (ICT) plays a critical role in many organisations of today. In both well-tried systems development methods as well as in recently improved object-oriented methods it is important to support development of ICT so that ICT could be adapted to the actual organisation. The methods provide prescribed and formal ways to perform the systems development. An ethnographical study has been performed in the NU health care organisation in Sweden. Another study is performed as a case study carried out at the Wing of Satenas, an airbase within the Swedish Air Force. The aim of this paper is to describe and analyse the character of professional work and its impact on systems development. Professions consist of special competences and attitudes to the work they are performing. The study of the health care workers and the flight technicians can also point this out."
A cognitive view of how IT professionals update their technical skills,Hsingyi Phoebe Tsai,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982387,"Frequent technological advances require IT professionals to update skills to ensure adequate performance. Yet relatively little research has studied skill obsolescence among IT professionals. This study builds upon work on skill obsolescence among engineers to understand how IT professionals respond to the threat of obsolescence and take actions to update technical skills. Interviews with five IT professionals were conducted as a pilot study. This data collection will be extended to include 15-20 technical IT professionals. The preliminary analysis of the data indicates that there are different conceptualizations of obsolescence and that these conceptualizations result in different sorts of coping strategies, ranging from planful problem-solving, to situation redefinition, and denial/distancing. Our continuing research will look for the drivers and consequences of adhering to these views of obsolescence."
A qualitative study of the occupational subculture of information systems employees in organizations,Indira R. Guzman,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982388,"Information Technology (IT) facilitates the effective functioning of most organizations. Individuals who support IT are an important facet to an organization. In the present study, we interviewed these individuals as well as other employees to identify their responsibilities, intra-group and inter-group communication. We used Trice's occupational subculture framework to look at the intrinsic differences among subcultures and its members. The results of our study suggest that conflicts arise from differences within members of subcultures. Observed situations of adaptation between occupational subcultures represent an example for remedy to rectify this conflict crisis."
IT offshoring in the professional media (1999-2003): a social representations analysis,Suzanne D. Pawlowski,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982390,"The offshore outsourcing of information technology services has been called an 'irreversible megatrend.' Management decisions regarding IT offshoring have major impacts on companies, their IT departments and IT professionals. The dislocation of IT jobs to countries such as India and China has also become a concern as offshore outsourcing continues to ramp up. Management decision-making concerning IT offshoring takes place within a complex and dynamic landscape of issues and options. Organizational actions related to IT offshoring are influenced by the cognitions, or mental models, of the managers making these decisions. The purpose of the research-in-progress study described in this paper is to examine one of the factors expected to influence how senior IT managers (CIOs, CTO's, VPs of IT, etc.) make sense of and assign meaning to IT offshore outsourcing: the IT professional media. Social representations theory will be used to identify and compare 'common sense knowledge' and discourse represented in five periodicals from the IT professional press with high readerships of senior IT managers. The paper presents an overview of social representations theory. Social representations are defined as the shared images and concepts through which we organize our world. The processes of objectification and anchoring in the formation of social representations are described, as well as the structural view of social representations including central core and peripheral elements. The research method for the study is content analysis and correspondence analysis to identify the social representations of IT offshore outsourcing in the professional media for each year from 1999-2003."
Recruitment is never enough: retention of women and minorities in the IT workplace,Andrea H. Tapia,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982392,"Women, as well as African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans are represented in the information technology (IT) workforce in percentages that are far lower than their percentages in the population as a whole. While recruiting efforts are crucial for increasing the participation of women and minorities, it is equally important that we retain those already in the IT workforce. Here we present an assessment of the relevant literature addressing retention issues for women and minorities. Some issues that arise from this literature can be applied directly to changes that must take place in the IT workplace such as; the development of gender/race/ethnic appropriate mentors, sponsors or role models in the work environment, the development of involvement of the family and/or community in support of the work environment, the development of a nurturing work environment to offset internalized out-group status, the development of a truly multicultural work environment that values gender/race/ethnic differences, the development of recognition of and assistance with stress from financial issues and social/family obligations, and the eradication of institutional practices that marginalize women and minorities. There is a need to deepen our understanding of retention issues for women and minorities in order to inform intervention strategies. This work addresses this need by providing an in-depth examination of factors affecting attraction, development and especially retention of minorities and women in IS."
Career orientation of IT personnel,Mary Sumner,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982394,"The management of information technology (IT) personnel poses unique challenges, including high turnover, limited advancement potential, low organizational commitment, and burnout. By matching individual expectations and job characteristics, managers may be able to provide IT professionals with appropriate opportunities and career paths. This study is designed to identify the career anchors or orientations which are possessed by IT personnel, and to identify which career anchors are the strongest determinants of organizational commitment. Based upon preliminary results of the pilot survey, the respondents expressed a variety of career anchors, including Organizational Stability, Variety, Managerial Competence, and Geographic Security. The career anchors and career orientation variables that were less important to the respondents were Identity, Technical Competence, Creativity, and Autonomy."
Veterans and internet use: implications for career preparation and development support,Abhijit Jain,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982395,"This research compares internet usage by veterans of the U.S. armed forces with internet usage by two reference groups - an educational-elite group and an educational-non-elite group. In terms of overall use, veterans are found to use the internet significantly less than members of the educational-elite reference group. This is cause for concern. Somewhat reassuringly, veterans are found to use the internet significantly more than members of the non-elite reference group.Effective and efficient use of the internet can potentially be enormously helpful to veterans in their transition out of armed forces life; and can help them adjust to, and get ahead in, civilian life and careers. This research suggests that agencies that look after veterans' interests, and provide counseling and training services to them, may find it rewarding to focus some of their attention towards increasing veterans' use of the internet. Thus this research has implications for issues related to career preparation and development support for veterans."
An examination of prestigious stigma: the case of the technology geek,Jo Ellen Moore,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982396,"The concept of stigma from social psychology traditionally pertains to the plight of individuals possessing ""marks"" such as physical deformities and blindness. In extending the construct to the organizational setting, stigma also encompasses less physical sources of non-normality that are viewed by others with disrespect or disapproval. Along this line, we identify an aspect of stigma that can materialize in work settings that generally does not appear in prior stigma theory. We argue that a stigma may exist that is worn with pride rather than shame, and we refer to this as a ""prestigious stigma."" As a foundation for our reasoning, we present ""technology geek"" as a prestigious stigma found in organizations. Our theory building focuses on mixed interactions of the stigmatized with others in the organization, positing that prestigiously stigmatized individuals behave in ways that differ from those previously theorized by social psychologists. This effort culminates in a model that extends prior stigma theory and provides insights for practice and future research."
The shadow knows: performance expectations of new hires in an IT organization,Diane Bandow,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982397,"As organizations reshape themselves to meet market and customer demands, expectations companies have of their employees change, which means employment contracts must also change. Social research on organizations has gained interest in recent years, but research on psychological contracts has been particularly limited. Rousseau (1995) noted the importance of performance expectations, but that these expectations were frequently not conveyed to employees, due, in part, to the dynamic nature of the industry and the market. Performance expectations, however, are of critical importance for organizations, as they provide predictability, enablement, and clarity (Rousseau, 1995), which are all essential for organizations, particularly in a dynamic environment.This paper examined performance expectations for newly hired information technology (IT) professionals in a systems development organization of a large telecommunications company in the US in 1998. Expectations of middle managers, upper managers, and technical team leaders were gathered and summarized, and analyzed for trends, differences, and similarities. The purpose of this pilot study was to explore expectations of both IT professionals and an IT organization, and provide a recent, accurate summary of expectations of new hires. The intent of this study was to assist prospective employees, newly hired employees, and hiring managers and their organizations by providing consistent documentation and clarity in organizational goals and expectations. Once preliminary areas are noted, additional research may then provide specific needs. By providing consistent, current and accurate information, IT professionals can learn more about the organization in less time, match their skills and goals more effectively to those of the organization, and quickly become contributing organizational members.For organizations, this could assist hiring managers by enabling common understandings, potentially reducing cost and turnover, increasing retention rates and creating more productive working relationships."
Perceptions of chilly IT organizational contexts and their effect on the retention and promotion of women in IT,Malu Roldan,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982399,"Research on gender differences suggests that women lack the personal characteristics necessary to flourish in male-dominated IT cultures and subcultures. Organizational research suggests that organizational cultures and climates can significantly affect participation and employment outcomes, such as the participation and promotion of women. ""Women-friendly"" workplaces exist (Working Women's ""100 Best Companies for Working Mothers""), yet female success in IT continues to decline. This paper lays the groundwork for a study of organizational contexts, organization members' perceptions of these contexts, and their effects on women's retention and promotion in IT organizations."
Understanding the under representation of women in IT: toward a theory of individual differences,Eileen M. Trauth,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982400,"Among the research challenges in studying the under representation of women in the IT field is that of developing appropriate theory to provide a basis for understanding and explanation about this gender imbalance. At present, there are two dominant theories in the gender literature that are used to explain the participation of women in the IT profession. The essentialist perspective dichotomizes gender based upon the presumption of significant inherent differences between women and men. This view finds the causes of gender under representation in biology. The social construction perspective focuses on the social construction of IT as a male domain, which is interpreted as incompatible with the social construction of female identity. This view finds the causes of gender under representation in the IT sector. The research discussed in this paper is directed at the development of a new theory that focuses on individual differences among women as they relate to the needs and characteristics of IT work and the IT workplace. This view finds the causes of gender under representation in the socio-cultural environment that shapes each woman's gender identity and her professional development, and her individual responses to these influences."
Exploring antecedents of gender equitable outcomes in IT higher education,Manju Ahuja,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982401,"This research-in-progress paper reports on a National Science Foundation funded project aimed at examining ways to engage women and girls in courses of study that will qualify and motivate them for information technology (IT)-related careers. This Information Technology Work Force (ITWF) award provides support to investigate 15 tertiary education programs in information systems, information science, instructional systems technology, and informatics, with computer science programs as a baseline comparison, in five major IT degree-granting institutions. The purpose of the study is to systematically investigate the contribution of organizational culture to student experiences and outcomes, determining factors that favor female success over time.The programs are hypothesized to be differentially responsive to female students due to differences in academic culture, operationalized in terms of the availability of mentorship, role models, peer support networks, grant programs, and other resources at the departmental, university, and disciplinary levels. These measures of organizational culture will be correlated with measures of student outcomes and self-reports of student experiences. Data about students' experiences will be collected through a web-based survey of a sample of 5,000 students, followed by three face-to-face interviews with an estimated 155 students, over-sampling for females, over a two-year period. In addition, faculty, administrators and staff in the study programs will be interviewed by telephone and in person. Student survey data will be collected by April 2004 and analyzed by May 2004.At the conference, we will report preliminary findings based on analysis of data collected from our pilot site (Indiana University).The project will identify encouraging and discouraging factors, and produce comparative statistics, that can be used as a baseline in future research on IT education and gender. Findings can be used to inform programmatic recommendations aimed at moving more women into the IT pipeline through a diverse range of educational programs. To the extent that new IT paradigms such as are taught in schools of information, informatics, education, and business help to create those cultural associations, they can contribute to reducing the persistent gender segregation in academic IT-related programs and thus IT employment."
The emotions of systems developers: an empirical study of affective events theory,Thomas Shaw,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982403,"The role of emotions in the workplace has received increasing attention from management theorists in recent years [2], yet information technology (IT) researchers have failed to consider the role of emotions on IT professionals. Many researchers approach IT from a human resources perspective that focuses on job outcomes such as stress, turnover, burnout, and satisfaction [3-6]. This study explores the emotions of IT professionals by addressing the research question: How can emotions help explain the job outcomes of IT workers?Affective Events Theory (AET) forms the theoretical foundation of this study. It argues that job outcomes can result from both affect or judgment-based processing. Attitudes are important in this process, but some outcomes result directly from emotions. Also, emotions are responses to work events that employees experience every day of their work lives. This potentially elevates the mundane events on the job as predictors of job outcomes.The study of AET in the IT domain uses an event-contingent experience sampling method. The subjects are senior-level IS undergraduate students engage in a semester long IS development project for their capstone Information Systems (IS) course. In addition to the daily emotion tracking data, the subjects completed questionnaires describing their levels of stress, burnout, and trust in their teammates. These methods and this theory hold promise in explaining job outcomes in the IT workplace."
Perceptions of accuracy: effects on computer attitudes and self-efficacy,Diane Lending,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982404,"With the introduction of any information system into an organization, user attitudes towards the system and self-efficacy (the confidence that the user can use the system) are an important consideration. When patient care systems are introduced into a hospital, hospital workers are rightly concerned about how accurate the records will be in the new system and how the system will affect patient care. In this study, we will investigate whether perceptions of accuracy affect computer attitudes and self-efficacy.In November 2003, we surveyed medical personnel at a regional hospital just prior to the introduction of a patient care system. We hope to better understand the relationships between these concepts."
IT project management and virtual teams,Catherine M. Beise,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982405,"Project management methods and tools are increasingly relevant as today's globalized organizations accomplish more of their goals using cross-functional, and often cross-cultural, geographically dispersed, project teams. The increased diversity of skills, knowledge, cultures, and perspectives of these project teams can potentially have both positive and negative influences on group processes and outcomes. The question that this research-in-progress intends to address is: To what extent can and do project management methods and tools benefit diverse virtual teams while mitigating its challenges? In order to begin to answer this question, this paper presents relevant background, a research model, a methodology (currently in progress), and potential contributions. The initial methodology involves a study of IT project teams working on a common database design project whose members are using electronic tools to communicate, collaborate, and coordinate. The results of the study should provide useful information to practitioners and researchers regarding project management and virtual teams."
Supporting ethical problem solving: an exploratory investigation,Russell W. Robbins,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982407,"The objective of this research was to investigate the use of decision aid technologies to support ethical problem solving. The decision aid developed for the exploratory study described in this paper was web-based and provided content that summarized and simplified much of moral philosophy (i.e. normative ethical theory) [3, 5, 11, 13, 18, 24, 26]. The ethical dilemma was posed in case format. Participants were asked to write, and revise as necessary, a solution to the case. The decision aid was developed to address five constructs in the research model: (1) Perceived Ethical Problem, (2) Perceived Alternatives, (3) Deontological Evaluation, (4) Teleological Evaluation, and (5) an Ethic of Care. Results from analysis showed that participants that used the decision aid identified the case's main issue, personal information privacy, more frequently than participants that did not use the decision aid. Individuals with support of the decision aid discussed the need to respect equal individual rights more often. Mixed results were found concerning use of other concepts from moral philosophy. An analysis technique was used that generated and statistically analyzed graphs that described how users navigated through decision problems. First, the participants' movements were captured as they went from page to page. These data were then used to construct depth-first-search trees (a particular type of graph). Characteristics of these trees were compared statistically, and the results showed no difference in the way control or treatment users navigated. Web-based ethical decision aids can be built and used, and can improve the solutions developed by students solving cases in a laboratory environment."
Improving software quality: an ethics based approach,Alan R. Peslak,"April 2004,",https://doi.org/10.1145/982372.982408,"Software quality in recent years has been plagued by significant quality issues. One of these issues is the rush to market of commercial software. This has resulted in poor quality leading to numerous updates and patches to correct inherent problems and to prevent malicious software attacks from viruses, worms, or other nefarious external hacking. The author believes that poor software quality presents an ethical issue for society. The issue of improvement in software quality is proposed to relate to fundamental ethical issues that need to be addressed by software developers. The author explores various philosophical ethical theories to address this issue including Aristotelian virtue ethics, and Humean virtue ethics, settling on Humean virtue ethics as the most effective approach. The author then proposes changes to industry codes of ethics as well as strengthening of the international software organizations as a social network to support necessary emphasis on proper software quality."
Is the information systems profession gendered?: characterization of IS professionals and IS careers,"Kshiti ""K.D"" Joshi","April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761851,"In spite of a more ""feminine"" nature of the IS disciplinedue to its greater perceived social component, stereotypes and educational prejudices that are prevalent in the computerscience discipline are assumed to exist in the information systems field. The objective of this study was to test the validity of this assumption by uncovering the perceptions of potential IS professionals, i.e., college students, toward IS professionals and the IS profession. Our study reveals that stereotypes found to be associated with computer science also seem to permeate the IS field. These stereotypic images do not fade away even after the students are more informed about IS careers. However, it does not fully support the assumption that women believe the field of information systems is identical to computer science. When describing an IS professional and the IS profession, women were cognizant about the unique nature of the IS field, i.e., the IS profession is a blend of technical, systems, social, and managerial components."
Examining gender differences in IT professionals' perceptions of job stress in response to technological change,Mike Gallivan,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761852,"This paper examines antecedents and consequences of IT professionals' perceptions of job stress within the context of assimilating a technological innovation in the workplace. Drawing on recent research on issues of gender within the IT profession (Ahuja 2002; Trauth 2002), as well as on recent studies into gender differences in workplace stress (Gardiner & Tiggeman 1999), we develop a conceptual framework to understand the phenomenon. We develop hypotheses about how the experiences of men and women IT professionals will differ in certain ways as they adopt and adapt to using a technological innovation. Using a mixed-method study of two firms that were adopting a technological innovation, we examine employees' reactions along gender lines. We found that perceived compatibility of the changes being assimilated was inversely related to employees' perceptions of stress for both men and women. While women experienced higher levels of stress and being overworked (as we predicted), there were also some unanticipated findings. Women IT professionals appeared to be more sensitive to the total number of elements in the work environment that were changing (total amount of change) as a precursor to stress. In the one firm where managers provided more autonomy but less supervision in adapting to the new technology, women reported considerably higher levels of stress. Based on both our expected and unexpected findings, we provide insights for IT practitioners to anticipate and manage workplace stress, and we offer future directions for researchers. We argue that our recommendations will allow employers to better accommodate the needs of a diverse workforce."
Constructing the IT skills shortage in Canada: the implications of institutional discourse and practices for the participation of women,Wendy Cukier,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761853,"Building on previous work, this paper explores systemic barriers to women in information technology professions by focusing on the ways in which institutional practices reinforce a definition of ""information technology professional"" that tends to exclude women. It examines the recent discourse on the ""Information Technology Skills Shortage"" in selected texts from industry, professional associations, academia and programs aimed at increasing the participation of women, focusing on the implications of discursive practices for the inclusion of women. In particular, it examines some of the apparent inconsistencies and contradictions which appear in the institutionalized discourse and practices.It argues that:1. With changing employment patterns, convergence of technologies and the expansion of e-business, professionals who combine technical skills with business and communication skills are needed more than ever.2. In spite of this, much of the discourse regarding the ""IT Skills Shortage"" focuses on Computer Science and Engineering and excludes other disciplines. It also emphasizes skills such as mathematics. These patterns are also reflected in the discourse regarding programmes aimed at increasing the participation of women.3. The discourse has unintended consequences by privileging disciplines which tend to be male dominated and excluding disciplines which include higher representations of women. The discourse also valorizing skills constructed as ""male"" such as math while devaluing those constructed as ""female"" such as communications skills. This is also reinforced in the discourse regarding programmes aimed at increasing the participation of women.4. The interaction of the industry, professional associations, educational institutions and the media produce and reproduce these discursive patterns regardless of their link to qualifications or skill requirements.5. These discourses are consistent with institutional theory, which suggests that certain practices may become widespread and ""taken-for-granted"" regardless of their link to actual performance or outcomes. The unintended consequence is systemic discrimination."
Development of an instrument to measure stress among software professionals: factor analytic study,K. S. Rajeswari,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761855,"This study investigates sources of negative pressure among software professionals, from the perspective of the software development process. A multiple response questionnaire (survey instrument) was developed to measure sources of pressure among software professionals, based on a series of interactions with academicians, software professionals and senior software professionals employed in software industry. Ten key factors that cause stress in software professionals are identified using exploratory factor analysis from 156 usable responses. These ten factors are found to explain nearly two-thirds of the variance. The results indicate that stress resulting from fear of obsolescence and individual team interactions account for maximum variance. The results reveal that the stress levels are not high, among the respondents of the current study. The implications of the study are discussed."
Conflict in collaborative software development,Madeline Ann Domino,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761856,"Pair Programming is an innovative collaborative software development methodology. Anecdotal and empirical evidence suggests that this agile development method produces better quality software in reduced time with higher levels of developer satisfaction. To date, little explanation has been offered as to why these improved performance outcomes occur. In this qualitative study, we focus on how individual differences, and specifically task conflict, impact results of the collaborative software development process and related outcomes. We illustrate that low to moderate levels of task conflict actually enhance performance, while high levels mitigate otherwise anticipated positive results."
Investigating the effects of downsizing on software professionals' self-efficacy and its consequences on software development quality,Ananth Chiravuri,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761857,"This study primarily examines the effects of downsizing on the self-efficacy of software professionals. We argue that downsizing results in a realignment of social networks, thereby affecting the self-efficacy and the outcome expectations of a software professional, which in turn affects software development quality. We synthesize relevant literature from self-efficacy, outcome expectations, downsizing and software quality research streams and develop a conceptual model linking these variables of interest."
Job characteristics and quality of working life in the IT workforce: the role of gender,Pascale Carayon,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761859,"Women are largely underrepresented in the Information Technology (IT) workforce. Our research examines the factors related to the work environment that may contribute to the high turnover of women in the IT workforce. There is substantial research providing support for the relationship between job and organizational factors, on one hand, and quality of working life (QWL) (e.g., low job satisfaction and high job strain), on the other hand. In this paper, we conduct secondary data analysis of questionnaire survey collected from a sample of 1,278 employees of a single organization. We examine the impact of gender and job type (i.e. IT job versus non-IT job) on various indicators of quality of working life, as well as on the relationship between job and organizational factors (i.e. feedback, autonomy, skill variety, task significance, task identity and work pressure) and QWL. Results show that IT workers reported higher job satisfaction and lower job strain than non-IT workers. Gender had no impact on QWL. Feedback and autonomy were consistently related to job satisfaction, and work pressure was consistently related to job strain, irrespective of gender and type of job. On the other hand, women IT workers' job satisfaction was affected by work pressure, and women IT workers' job strain was affected by task significance. Women IT workers' job strain was not affected by autonomy, whereas job strain experienced by non-IT workers was affected by autonomy."
Hostile_work_environment.com,Andrea Hoplight Tapia,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761860,"In this paper I discuss the behaviors and efforts of the male employees of one small software development company, which was born and died during the gold rush mentality that captivated many start-ups during the Dot.Com Bubble. From evidence drawn from interviews, observations, self-reported organizational charts and time diaries, I argue that the organizational culture, created by the original and managerial employees of this company, made it nearly impossible for female employees to be hired. I also claim that once a few female employees were hired, the organizational culture made the work environment so hostile that it drove them to leave and seek alternative employment. I argue these points from both a social constructivist and an individual differences theoretical points of view. The conclusions that I draw from this case study are that the Dot Com Bubble did more to impede women from the IT workforce than to facilitate their entrance."
Women talking about IT work: duality or dualism?,Sue. H. Nielsen,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761861,"This paper explores the way that professional women working in the IT industry discuss the nature of their work. The research is part of an ongoing project (WinIT) commenced in 1995, which seeks to understand the declining female participation in IT education and work. An examination of our interview data using concepts from Giddens' structuration theory shows that a number of dualisms provide the women with interpretive schemes through which they can interpret and make sense of their working lives. Such dualisms may provide ontological security as representations of the routines which women in the IT industry enact in their daily activities. This paper suggests that the way women talk about their work reinforces widely held impressions of the IT industry. The use of structuration theory helps show how this talk is not always consistent with the womens' lived experiences. The interviews reveal contradictions in these dualisms, indicating that these polarised views of women and IT work are being undermined by women in the IT industry. In order to understand better how women help configure the institutional realm of IT work, we propose that more qualitative studies of women at work in IT as well as women talking about IT are needed."
A best-practice based model for information technology learning strategy formulation,Lorne Olfman,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761863,"In today's fast changing environment marked by innovation in information technology (IT) at great speed, organizations need to take a holistic view of IT training by formulating comprehensive learning strategies. In this paper, we propose an integrative learning strategy formulation model that we developed based on the findings of a study that used a multiple case study approach. We analyzed 16 organizations with leading edge training behaviors to identify best practices for learning strategies. The model we propose is composed of four dimensions, which we call Focus, Conceptualization, Integration and Positioning. We describe the model and mechanisms for moving an organization toward best practices in implementing and applying a learning strategy."
ERP training strategies: conceptual training and the formation of accurate mental models,Tony Coulson,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761864,"Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are large, complex integrated software applications that often take years to implement. This study examined a major determinant of successful ERP implementation, end-user training. Specifically, this study advances research in the area of ERP software through examining end-user training strategies that may impact the effective use of these complex systems. The Sein, Bostrom, and Olfman [19] Hierarchical Knowledge-Level model is applied in an experiment to develop more effective ERP training strategies. The experiment was a non-equivalent quasi-experimental design involving two groups of approximately 35 senior business students: one group was given the introduction of ERP workflow concepts as an advance organizer (TCT Group); the other received traditional, procedurally-oriented (PT Group) ERP training over the same 5 week time period. A series of post-test measures were administered after each training treatment, and ten days after all treatments concluded. The study finds that a workflow conceptual advanced organizer strategy (TCT group) improves end-users' mental model accuracy over time as demonstrated by the subjects' ability to recall ERP specific concepts. Results indicate that a conceptual advance organizer is an important component of ERP training and should be incorporated into an organization's training strategy."

Electronic commerce personnel in the age of clicks and mortar: toward a framework of individual and project level skills,Fred Niederman,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761866,"With the explosive growth of Internet, the need for individuals to build and maintain electronic commerce programs has emerged. E-commerce sites have the dual challenges of appealing enough to users to purchasing online as well as running flawlessly to support secure transactions. Thus, e-commerce personnel need to integrate the creativity of delighting users with reliable technology. This paper examines the staffing of e-commerce teams and particularly focuses on skills needed and how they should be arranged. This paper details how e-commerce staffing should include IT professionals, web publication specialists, and hybrid professionals with skill profiles combining IT and publication abilities. This paper also presents a model of the particular skill set needed for staffing an e-commerce team. Finally, the paper discusses e-commerce positions in light of likely trends in employment and technology."
"Triple jeopardy: race, gender and class politics of women in technology",Lynette Kvasny,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761868,"In this paper, I consider how class, race, and gender influence perspectives regarding information technology (IT). I do so by considering how participants in a community technology center located in an inner city neighborhood conceptualize IT, and how their standpoints shape their beliefs in the opportunities and rewards that are enabled by IT. Using the metaphor of ascension, their narratives constructed IT as a mechanism for liberating entire classes of women economically and socially. These findings suggest that the perspectives regarding IT held by the women participating in this study contradict the findings presented in prior IT and gender studies that generally take as their focus highly educated, middle-class women working in the IT profession and women studying at universities in disciplines that prepare them for entry into the IT profession. These divergent findings suggest a need for additional research that specifically addresses the joint effects of race, class and gender in contexts beyond the IT workplace environment, and with a broader diversity of women."
Diversity and the information technology workforce: an examination of student perceptions,A. Woszczynski,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761869,"Most IT professionals would agree that diversity in IT leads to positive outcomes. However, few studies have empirically tested differences in diversity perceptions among groups. This research-in-progress develops a survey to test perceptions in four diversity categories: gender, ethnicity, age, and disability. Currently, we have begun collecting data from students in three universities. Upon completion of data collection, we plan to validate the survey instrument using factor analysis. Then we will test a series of directional hypotheses theorizing differences in diversity perceptions among groups. We will use multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to analyze group differences and possible interaction effects. Upon completion of the study, we anticipate empirically validating a survey instrument to be used in future diversity studies, while also providing support for differences in diversity perceptions between the groups analyzed."
Views from the field on mentoring and roles of effective networks for minority IT doctoral students,Fay Cobb Payton,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761870,"With the changing demographics of the American workforce, the National Science Foundation along with the U.S. Department of Commerce have highlighted the shortage of minorities in IT careers (<u>http://www.ta.doc.gov/Reports/itsw/itsw.pdf</u>). Meeting the IT skill challenge is critical and will require a multifaceted approach. One approach to this challenge is the development of mentoring networks, and a large body of knowledge has offered contributions to understanding the importance of mentoring throughout one's career. Mentoring among minorities in corporate domains has proven to be both challenging and effective for professional development and career success. Using data from a five-year period and a learning process diversity competency model as defined by Cox and Beale (1997), we discuss lessons learned from mentoring a group of under-represented Information Systems (IS) doctoral students who are members of a pipeline that will increase the number of IT professionals in business schools and in the American workforce, in general. While our lessons speak to more diversity awareness and the need for more mentors of color as well as those in the majority to enhance professional development, and in turn career success for minorities, we also speak of the challenges and rewards associated with providing mentorship during our ""untenured"" years in the academy."
Turnover of IT professionals: a quantitative analysis of the literature,Damien Joseph,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761872,"IT scholars have long been interested in the turnover of IT professionals. In their many studies, IT scholars have considered a wide range of predictors of IT turnover including personal characteristics, role constructs, job characteristics, and organizational characteristics. In this paper, we conduct a meta-analysis to summarize this body of research. The objective of this paper is, therefore, to examine the bivariate relationships of predictors with IT turnover. The meta-analytic results on the relationships with turnover are consistent with theory and prior empirical research."
Decision paths affecting turnover among information technology professionals,Fred Niederman,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761873,"The purpose of this study was to better understand the factors influencing voluntary turnover particularly among information technology (IT) professionals. Toward that end, we tested the ""unfolding model of voluntary turnover"" as it applies to IT professionals.

In contrast to previously theorized decision pathways, the majority of respondents following a wide variety of ""atheoretical"" paths."
Returns to human capital for information technology professionals,Sandra Slaughter,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761874,"This study examines compensation-tenure profiles using detailed salary data collected on IT professionals. Consistent with human capital theory, findings show that compensation increases with organizational tenure for all IT jobs. However, for a given level of organizational tenure, individuals in IT jobs requiring more firm-specific human capital are paid more on average than those in IT jobs requiring less-firm specific human capital. Our results suggest the importance of job type in examining compensation-tenure profiles in IT where the value of technical human capital can diminish while the value of firm-specific human capital can appreciate with organizational tenure."
An examination of the relationships between select nature of work characteristics and organizational commitment of IT professionals,Tim Klaus,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761875,"One of the problems faced by IT managers in periods of prosperity and economic constraint is turnover. The effects of turnover, especially in times of growth, include escalating hiring and training costs. In more challenging economic times, turnover of key employees can jeopardize organizational sustenance. IT professionals' level of commitment to the organization is important in minimizing turnover. This study explores the nature of work context within the IT context and asserts that nature of work as contextually specified contributes to an IT professional's commitment to the organization. Nature of work in the IT context is expressed as core job characteristics, the level of group cohesion, and the level of role stress. IT managers and organizations can use this information to guide project assignment job decisions and improve job and work design to increase organizational commitment and ultimately to increase retention."

The key factors named by respondents that would play an important role in shaping retention in the industry are identified, including pay, hours of work in a typical workweek, and the intrinsic nature of the work. This preliminary analysis will be further analyzed, in addition to drawing on 200 in-depth interviews with men and women in software and Internet workplaces, to gain a richer understanding of the factors shaping the participation of men and women in the industry."
A study to identify predictors of achievement in an introductory computer science course,Sandra Katz,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761879,"In the study reported on here, 65 prospective computer or information science majors (47 male, 18 female) worked through a tutorial on the basics of Perl. All actions were recorded and time-stamped, allowing us to investigate the relationship between six factors that we believed would predict performance in an introductory computer science (CS) course (as measured by course grade) and how much students would learn from the tutorial (as measured by gain score from pre-test to post-test). These factors are: preparation (SAT score, number of previous CS courses taken, and pre-test score), time spent on the tutorial as a whole and on individual sections, amount and type of experimentation, programming accuracy and/or proficiency, approach to materials that involve mathematical formalisms, and approach to learning highly unfamiliar material (string manipulation procedures). Gender differences with respect to these factors were also investigated.Predictors of grade and gain score included SAT score, pre-test score (negatively correlated with gain), time (negatively correlated with gain and grade), and various measures of programming accuracy and/or proficiency---for example, the total number of program runs that contained errors (negatively correlated with grade and gain). Several measures of experimentation predicted gain score. Experimentation also predicted grade, but only as applied to the least familiar tutorial material. Although experimentation was practiced throughout the tutorial by both sexes, male and female students differed with respect to the types of tutorial topics and tasks they experimented with and the degree of experimentation---for example, male students were more likely to write programs not suggested by the tutorial. These findings suggest that a tutorial such as the one used in this study could serve as an instrument to identify students who are likely to succeed (or not) in an introductory CS course, and that instructional interventions to promote achievement should encourage experimentation, reflection on the results of experiments, care and accuracy."
Two predictors of CEO/CIO convergence,Alice M. Johnson,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761881,"Effective communication and mutual understanding (i.e., convergence) between an organization's chief executive officer and chief information officer is an important factor in an organization's efforts to successfully exploit information technology. Communications theory predicts that greater communication frequency and channel richness lead to more such convergence. This research used a mail survey of 202 pairs of CEOs and CIOs to investigate the effect of communication frequency and channel richness on CEO/CIO convergence. More frequent communication between the CEO and CIO predicted convergence about the current and future role of IT. The use of richer channels did not predict convergence about the current role of IT. From a research perspective, the study extended theory about communication frequency, media richness, convergence, and the role of IT in organizations. It also provided additional validation of existing instruments to help future researchers studying communication and IT. From a managerial perspective, it provided direction for CEOs and CIOs who may be interested in increasing their mutual understanding of the role of IT and thus improving their relationship with each other."
Instrument validation for investigating a model of employment arrangement fit for IT professionals,Thomas W. Ferratt,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761882,"A model of employment arrangement fit for IT professionals in traditional (e.g., permanent, full-time employee) and contractor positions has been proposed by Enns, Ferratt, and Prasad (2002). Employment arrangement fit is based on differences between an IT professional's preferred employment arrangement and the employment arrangement provided by an employer. The dimensions of the employment arrangement on which these differences are calculated include length, depth, specificity of performance requirements, economic benefits, risk, career development opportunities, work discretion, and work location discretion. This research-in-progress presents the results of pilot studies to conduct initial investigations of the validity of an instrument to measure employment arrangement fit. These results include the instrument's psychometric properties and its ability to reflect the nomological network of relationships in the model for traditional and contract IT professionals."

The management structure of the telecommunications function in healthcare organizations: an exploratory study,Karen Ketler,"April 2003,",https://doi.org/10.1145/761849.761884,"This article reports the results of 154 responses from IS managers in healthcare organizations about the managerial structure of the telecommunications function. While a one-tiered management structure with an IS manager was the most common form of management of the telecommunications function, a multi-tiered approach was utilized in over 38% of the organizations. Steering committees were utilized more often with a generalized IS manager than with a specialized telecommunications manager. Organizations with steering committees were more likely to provide organizational support for the telecommunications function than the other organizations. There was no statistical significance between organizations with steering committees and those without such a committee on the development and implementation of a telecommunications plan. However, there was a strong correlation between the decision-making authority of the steering committee and the development and implementation of a telecommunications plan."

An analysis of the changing demand patterns for information technology professionals,Mike Gallivan,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512363,"This paper examines trends in required job skills for IT professionals. Through an empirical study of a dataset of job advertisements for IT professionals over the past thirteen years, we evaluate whether the observed trends support earlier predictions offered by researchers who sought to anticipate future job and skill demands (Leitheiser, 1992; Trauth, Farwell, & Lee, 1993). We also looked for evidence for whether the so-called expectation gap between employers' demands and the skills provided by academic programs still exists (Lee, Trauth & Farwell, 1995). Many of the findings are consistent with previous studies and support the notion that employers are seeking an ever-increasing number and variety of skill sets from the new hires. Although we were unable to assess whether or how the expectation gap had changed, we did find evidence of a recruitment gap where, despite many firms' emphasis on well-rounded individuals with business knowledge and good ""soft skills,"" the job advertising aspect of the recruiting process continues to focus on ""hard skills."" We speculate that this occurs because it is easier to screen for technical skills through such advertisements, whereas assessment of interpersonal skills requires a face-to-face interview."
Explaining an IT professional's preferred employment duration: empirical tests of a causal model of antecedents,Ritu Agarwal,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512364,"Prior research, drawing upon Rousseau's (1995) conception of psychological contracts, proposes that a critical antecedent of staying behavior is an IT professional's preferred employment duration. In previous work we further examined the antecedents of this construct, and argued that preferred employment duration is jointly determined by career anchor, life stage, and competencies of the IT professional, with the type of the employing organization serving as a potentially moderating factor. This paper presents empirical tests of the proposed conceptual model. An experiment with IT professionals at the entry stage of their careers shows that preferred employment duration is significantly influenced by the career anchors of job security and technical competence. We also find that the characteristics of the employing organization, viz., risk and variety, influence preferred employment duration. Perceived variety has a direct effect, while perceived risk negatively moderates the effects of the career anchor of job security on preferred employment duration."
The role of the work itself: an empirical examination of intrinsic motivation's influence on IT workers attitudes and intentions,Jason Bennett Thatcher,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512365,"This study examines intrinsic motivation's influence on information technology (IT) attitudes and intensions. Intrinsic motivation is modeled as mediating the influence of motivators (i.e., intrinsic job characteristics) and hygiene factors (i.e., pay and supervisory satisfaction) on workplace attitudes (i.e., job satisfaction and affective commitment). In turn, workplace attitudes mediate the influence of intrinsic motivation on turnover intention. The model was tested using data collected from public sector IT workers in the Southeastern United States. Although intrinsic motivation did not fully mediate the influence of motivators and hygiene factors, findings suggest that intrinsic motivation positively influences workplace attitudes and has a mediated influence on turnover intent. Implications for research and practice are offered."
Telecommunications instruction in healthcare organizations: education or training?,Karen Ketler,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512367,"This article reports the result of a nationwide survey of healthcare organizations about 1) the sources of telecommunications training, 2) the quality of the training provided by the various sources, and 3) the impact of the training on the perceived importance of telecommunications to the organizations. While self-instruction was the most common form of telecommunications training, sources external to the organizations were more widely used than in-house training. In particular, workshops, seminars and vendor-authorized training were more widely used than organizational sources, with training from educational institutions being used the least. The quality of training provided by workshops, seminars and vendor-supplied training was rated higher than the quality of training provided by educational institutions and organizational sources. Self-instruction was rated the lowest in quality. However, there is one bright spot for educational institutions. Individuals with telecommunications training from an educational institution rated the importance of telecommunications higher than individuals with training from other providers. It is anticipated that individuals who have received training at an educational institution have a clearer vision of the future and the potential benefits of telecommunications."
"Training effectiveness, on-line delivery and the influence of learning style",Harry C. Benham,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512368,This study compares the effectiveness of on-line training and traditional training of students in a computer literacy course. Scores on lab exercises and exams measured training effectiveness. Student learning style measures were included in the analysis. The analysis suggests that learning style does influence training effectiveness and that on-line training is significantly less effective for some learning styles.
Determinants of user satisfaction with the support function,Hallgeir Nilsen,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512369,"In this paper, we present a research-in-progress study of the problem diagnosis phase of an action research project. The aim of the project is to improve the end user support function of a local municipality in Scandinavia. Five years ago, the municipality initiated a program of using unit personnel to train and support end users. Now, it is becoming apparent that the much acclaimed program is not functioning as well as it used to or as expected. We were called in by the municipality to help them improve the support function. That led to the ongoing action research project. As part of the problem diagnosis phase, we are conducting a three-step study using quantitative (survey) and qualitative (interviews, document analysis) to tease out any systematic patterns about success or failure of LM's user support program. The survey and several interviews have already been conducted. We are analysing the data to determine which of a variety of factors: social, organisational, political and individual are related to dissatisfaction with the support function. The findings will seek to explain what can go wrong with a best practice when factors blend."
A design of an empirical study of the applicability of the technology acceptance model to outsourcing decisions,"John ""Skip"" Benamati","May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512371,"The outsourcing industry has grown rapidly. Many organizations choose outsourcing as a way to address skills shortages. This study synthesizes factors from prior outsourcing research and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). TAM suggested that perceived usefulness and ease of use mediate the effects of other variables on users' attitudes towards a technology. The model in this study suggests that perceived usefulness and ease of use of outsourcing mediate the effects of the external environment, risk, and prior outsourcing relationships on outsourcing decision-makers. A quantitative instrument is under development and will be used to test the proposed model."
IT outsourcing in the healthcare sector: the case of a state general hospital,John C. Sarivougioukas,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512372,"This paper discusses the outsource solution that was selected during the deployment of an Information Technology (IT) project concerning the introduction of a Clinical Information System (CIS) in a Greek state hospital. During the early stages of the project, it was realized that the Management Information Systems (MIS) department was unable to satisfy the unexpectedly increased users' needs and provide to them the adequate supporting services. Also, it was noticed the rather negative reaction of the users to the newly computerized working environment. Certain corrective actions and measures had to be taken in order to protect the investment and to end the project successfully. The decision focused on two issues, first, the outsourcing of the entire CIS operation, and second, the outsourcing of the data entry operations. A year later that decision proved to be adequate having a Clinical Information system operating in an acceptable manner and at the same time having users who are performing a number of the CIS operations without the assistance of the outsource personnel."

"""Never the twain shall meet"": exploring the differences between Japanese and Norwegian IS professionals",Erling S. Andersen,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512375,"This study focuses on the IS professionals of Japan and Norway and investigates whether there are more similarities between them on professional factors than on factors influenced by their respective national cultures.A survey was conducted and there was support for the folowing hypothesis: IS professionals in Japan and Norway are different, both in terms of their general culture and in their views on life and work. They also differ in terms of IS job satisfaction and values. It was also found that there were stronger similarities between them on some professional factors than on those unrelated to the IS field."
Intercultural work assignments in global software development preparation for entry and re-entry,Stanley J. Birkin,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512376,"Global software is needed to support global business activities for companies whose processes, staffs, markets, and customers are increasingly worldwide in scope. This development creates a need for intercultural work assignments. While some development is done by virtual global teams, co-location of IS professionals in other cultures during the deployment of systems is also common. This research study in progress involves semi-structured interviews with IS managers and developers and a mailed survey of IS personnel, and focuses on the adjustment to and from an intercultural work assignment for IS professionals. It also explores research questions dealing with issues involving: types of preparation of IS professionals for intercultural work assignments and repatriation; individual differences between IS professionals, including preparedness for intercultural work, that predict success in such assignments and repatriation; and the impact of cultural novelty on successful transitions to and from overseas work. The contributions anticipated from the study are an understanding of how the nature of preparation for overseas assignments and individual differences impact the success of co-located IS professionals."
Applying agile software development processes to global virtual teams: a study of communication modalities,Madeline Domino,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512377,"Today's information technology (IT) environment dictates speed, flexibility and a people-centered focus. Many of the new emerging agile software development processes accomplish these goals by calling for team collaboration in face-to-face settings. Globalization and the pressure to lower development costs have increased the utilization of virtual teams. These virtual teams represent a new organizational form that does not provide for same proximity collaboration. We propose an experiment that explores the impacts of different communication modalities in face-to-face and global virtual software development environments."
Career anchors of United States Air Force information systems workers: a turnover predictor?,Lee A. Wynne,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512379,"Companies throughout the world have been challenged by poor retention and high turnover of their information systems (IS) employees. The United States Air Force (USAF) has experienced the same trend in its IS workforce. This study measured the career anchors, job satisfaction, and turnover intention of USAF IS workers (n = 2,724) to determine if those whose job type and career anchor matched reported higher satisfaction and lower turnover intention than those whose job type and career anchor did not match. Results suggest that USAF IS workers are significantly different than civilian IS workers in what they consider important in a career. Specifically, USAF IS workers appear to place an overriding importance on job security, service, and life-style factors, but do exhibit underlying technical and managerial anchors as was discovered through an analysis of ""relative anchors"". Finally, results suggest that job type and career anchor compatibility alone may not be an adequate predictor of job satisfaction or turnover intention."
Trust and the automated assessment of IT skills,R. D.

The paper considers the issues which influence trust in traditional assessment, how the same issues differ for computer-based assessment and how the influence of the differences on trust can be minimised. Finally the paper discusses how future developments may be influenced by issues of trust."
Application domain competence in software requirements: deconstructing a unified approach,Stig Nordheim,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512381,"In this paper, we present a research-in-progress study that examines the issue of how application domain competence is addressed in systems development literature. The underlying questions are: how does the area of systems development approach the concept of application domain? What steps do we take to ensure sufficient application domain competence when developing systems? We address this question by analyzing a recent practical book on software requirements in the unified approach series, to get a picture of how this important area for IT professional is presented and prescribed."
What predicts student performance in the first college-level IS course?: is it different for men and women?,Diane Lending,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512383,"The information systems (IS) profession is one of the fastest growing occupations and the demand for IS professionals is expected to continue growing over the next several years [3]. However, many sources report a growing gap between the demand for IS workers and the supply of such workers [3]. Further exacerbating this gap is the fact the percentage of women earning degrees in the field has declined since 1986 [5]. In order to adequately staff the IS profession, we need to make sure that a sufficient number of both male and female students are completing information systems degrees. Low grades in the early required classes account for much of the attrition of women from scientific and mathematics classes [9]. Therefore, one of the ways to ensure students complete an information systems degree is to assure success in the early information systems classes.This paper proposes a way to predict academic performance in the first college-level information systems class. In earlier research [8], we developed a model to measure performance in this class based on models used in accounting classes [6]. When we used this model we found different patterns than had been found in accounting classes. Our results showed that the Eskew and Faley [6] model predicted male student performance in the class but did not predict female performance. In this paper, we extend the model to try to improve the prediction. This model will be compared for male and female students. We hope to show what determines performance and thus better understand how students of both genders can be successful in the first college-level IS course."

A summary of conclusions and overall findings points out the good (and the bad) in our newly minted IT professionals."
A model for examination of underrepresented groups in the IT workforce,Catherine Beise,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512385,The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors that attract as well as discourage women and other students who display an initial interest in IT careers. Of particular interest is the comparison of computer science (CS) and information systems (IS) majors because prior research has focused almost exclusively on CS students. An initial investigation of success rates in the first programming course at two universities indicates that neither gender nor age is a good predictor of success in this course. This paper presents a research model based on review of the literature and on Vroom's expectancy theory. Future research will examine the relationships between predictor variables and valence and expectancy regarding IT as a career.
Antecedents and consequences of traditional and virtual IT professionals' satisfaction with employment arrangements,Harvey G. Enns,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512387,"As virtual work becomes more common among information technology (IT) professionals, it is important to understand the differences between traditional and virtual employment arrangements. Based on an examination of literature on psychological contracts and work arrangements and interviews with virtual IT workers and IT HR managers, six dimensions of employment arrangements -- length, depth, discretion, career development opportunities, compensation level, and risk -- are identified to illuminate these differences. How well employers meet IT professionals' preferences for the valued outcomes represented by these dimensions, i.e., IT professionals' satisfaction with their employment arrangements (or employment arrangement fit), is the central construct in the conceptual model elaborated here. A methodology for empirically investigating this conceptual model is outlined."
Knowledge integration and individual expertise development in e-business project teams: prom the pod to the peas,Amrit Tiwana,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512388,"The use of a knowledge-based logic for organizing project teams has received increasing attention from information systems scholars. This view contends that successful knowledge integration positively contributes to IS project success, especially when the necessary expertise for a project is distributed among individuals from different functional areas. Proponents of this view argue that knowledge integration is effective because it minimizes the need for learning and maximizes the sharing of individual expertise within the context of a projec.Two recent IS studies have found that sharing individual expertise across traditionally disparate knowledge domains is a critical ingredient of team effectiveness. This on-going study raises the question of whether knowledge integration at the team level also contributes to individual expertise development (as a result of participation in a project).We hypothesize two sets of relationships. First, we hypothesize that knowledge integration curvilinearly influences individual expertise development. Second, we hypothesize that individual expertise development is a more significant predictor of individual team members' satisfaction with team processes (a mediation effect). Individual expertise development is conceptualized as a second-order construct that is composed of two first-order variables, individual learning and professional growth. The former adds directly to domain-specific individual knowledge bases while the latter involves systemic learning.A multi-level model is developed to test these relationships. Data collection methods, using a sample of 142 individuals in 42 zero-history e-business project teams, are described along with scale development and validation procedures.Knowledge integration at the team level has a potential dark side at the individual level. The key contribution of this study is development and testing of a multilevel model linking expertise development at the individual level to knowledge integration at the team level. Clearly, balancing short-term gains in terms of increased project success versus long-term gains in terms of individual expertise development raises some puzzling challenges for e-business project managers. Managers cannot forsake successful execution of e-business software projects at ""Internet speed,"" especially when the future competitiveness of their firm hinges on their success. Nonetheless, inattention to individual's expertise development will contribute to the rapid obsolesce of IT personnel's expertise and potentially trigger their attrition. By testing the relationships between these variables, our findings can guide managers in assembling temporary project teams that might create win-win scenarios for both a project that demands innovative integration of expertise and for the individuals who execute that project."
Should I stay or should I go?: the role of trust and risk in determining behavior in an IS development team,Mark Fuller,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512389,"This research extends the Mayer, Davis & Schoorman (1995) model of interpersonal trust to examine the evolution of trust between teams. Risk-taking actions by teams were found to predict the evolution of trust over time. Using a controlled setting to reduce the impact of extraneous variables and a cross-source design to collect data, we studied reciprocal trust between managers and developers, specifically examining whether trusting behaviors exhibited by one team influence perceptions of that team's trustworthiness held by an interdependent team. Findings indicate that ability, benevolence and integrity are stable predictors of trust in this interteam context. Further, trust was found to significantly influence teams' risk-taking behaviors. Finally, risk-taking behaviors by one team were found to have a reciprocal effect on perceptions of trustworthiness by the interdependent team."
Toward understanding the relationship between IT human resource management systems and retention: an empirical analysis based on multiple theoretical and measurement approaches,Ritu Agarwal,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512391,"Organizations design their human resource management (HRM) systems to achieve a variety of goals such as developing and retaining employees, increasing productivity, and enhancing overall firm performance. However, the mechanisms through which HRM systems exhibit these effects are less understood. The focus of this work is on illuminating the relationship between HRM systems and one important organizational outcome: employee retention, in the context of the IT function. We ask the question ""Does an HRM system have an effect on the intentions to stay of IT professionals?"" Arguments in support of this relationship are developed from two different theoretical perspectives: the rational HRM system view and the behavioral or enacted HRM system view. We apply these perspectives at different levels of analyses with multiple measurement approaches to field data collected from over 350 IT professionals in 10 organizations. Results show that, in general, the enacted HRM system perspective explains greater variance in intentions to stay. The group and individual levels of analysis offer more explanatory power than the organizational level of analysis, and indirect measures of HRM systems explain intentions to stay better than direct measures. Theoretical and pragmatic implications of the findings are presented."
Internal labor market strategies and turnover of information technology professionals,Sandra Slaughter,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512392,"Turnover is an important issue for organizations that employ Information Technology (IT) professionals. Much of the prior research on IT professionals has searched for causes of turnover from the perspective of the individual worker, examining factors such as job dissatisfaction, career orientation mismatch, and job compensation inadequacies. In this study, we examine the role of Internal Labor Market Strategies (ILMs) in retaining IT workers. We examine data collected from multiple informants on the ILM strategies for major IT occupations in IT organizations using agglomerative hierarchical clustering techniques. Our results suggest that there are distinct patterns in organizations' IT human resource strategies, that these strategies relate to differential turnover rates, and that organizational contingencies influence the deployment of these strategies."
The social context of turnover among information technology professionals,Patrick Chang Boon Lee,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512393,"This study focuses on the role played by social support from supervisors and colleagues in helping to minimize turnover intentions among computer professionals. Although the concept of social support has been widely used in the occupational stress literature, it has rarely been applied in turnover research. This study explains why social support is particularly salient to computer professionals' turnover. It develops a model that posits that (i) social support is positively related to job satisfaction, (ii) social support is negatively related to turnover intentions, and (iii) social affiliation needs moderate the relationship between social support and turnover intentions. The model is tested using data collected from a questionnaire survey. The results support six of the seven hypotheses. Specifically, they indicate that workplace social support is negatively related to turnover intentions for computer professionals with high social affiliation needs, and that job satisfaction mediates the relationship between social support and turnover intentions. Implications of the results are discussed."

Wingreen,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512396,"Employers have been forced to use more and more creative methods to retain their most skilled IT professionals, as is aimed at helping the IT professional keep their skills current in the fast-paced, dynamic IT environment. Instrumentation has been developed for this study to measure the ""fit"" between an organization's offerings of training resources and the IT professional's perceived training needs. As such ""training climate fit"" is conceptualized as a sub-dimension of person-organization fit. A structural equation model is proposed to investigate the relationship between the IT professional's individual factors of self-efficacy, locus of control, training climate fit, and turnover intentions."
A research participatory approach to managing knowledge workers,Sofiane Sahraoui,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512397,"Management of end-user computing has gradually evolved into the management of knowledge workers following the advent of the knowledge-intensive environment in organizations. This new environment, characterized by a dissemination of relational knowledge among the knowledge worker community, warrants a new approach to managing knowledge workers as an alternative to the traditional functional approach. The limitations of a functional approach are highlighted from a double perspective, the first is the subdivision of the organization into thinkers and doers, and the second is its inadaptability in non-western contexts. A participatory research approach is introduced as a suitable alternative befitting the knowledge-intensive environment. Its implications for managing knowledge workers are also provided."
Paradigms for organizing a global IT workforce,Paul Weinberg,"May 2002,",https://doi.org/10.1145/512360.512361,"This panel is intended to explore factors related to the successful management of Global IT initiatives. There are many unique challenges. Multi-national organizations often want to standardize the processes and systems they use. However, customization may be required to meet local requirements and compete with indigenous organizations. Operating across time zones, makes synchronous collaboration difficult. Rapid development methodologies, which usually require multiple design iterations, have to be modified. Cultural differences often require unique approaches to local management, but have to be bridged to support global initiatives. Interpretation of design communications may vary significantly from country to country. Management philosophies vary widely and management techniques are changing rapidly as collaboration technologies evolve. Successful organizations often use counter-intuitive models. A model for the characterization of global IT organizations, will be used to compare the approaches utilized by successful organizations, and discuss CSFs. Practitioners and academics on the panel will present cases related to CSFs, and interpret these cases with respect to management models."
Workforce retention: what do IT employees really want?,Guy ParÃ©,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371208,The purpose of this study is to present and test an integrated model of turnover intentions that addresses the unique nature of the IT profession. We identified a multidimensional set of HR practices likely to increase retention among IT employees and considered citizenship behaviors as well as two distinct types of organizational commitment as key antecedents of turnover intentions. A questionnaire was developed and sent to the Quebec members of the Canadian Information Processing Society. Data from 394 respondents were used to validate the measures and test the research hypotheses. We present and discuss the results and make a series of recommendations for IT and HR executives.
Job turnover among MIS professionals: an exploratory study of employee turnover,Fred Niederman,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371210,"The paper addresses the issue of IT worker turnover. It reports on a survey IT workers who graduated over the past decade (1990-1999) from Saint Louis University. Research questions target IT worker demographics, such as age and gender and job satisfaction, salary, job tasks, and opportunity factors for both prior and current employment. Results included ranking of different factors comprising job satisfaction (satisfaction with financial compensation was high and with fringe benefits was low), observation of significant differences between several satisfaction measures but no task measures between prior and current job, and observation of few correlations between specific tasks performed and salary levels."
A tale of two shortages: an analysis of the IT professional and MIS faculty shortages,Timothy Babbitt,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371211,"There are hundreds of articles, numerous governmental research papers and congressional acts that are focused on attending to a shortage or information technology (IT) labor. Many predict a crippling effect from such a shortage, and a minority opinion suggests that there is no shortage. In part, this difference may reflect a lack of conceptual clarity of what constitutes a shortage. This paper, then, examines the nature of what shortages are, how shortages might look in the context of IT professionals and MIS faculty, and how we might be able to ascertain the nature of the IT labor and faculty shortages. The outcome is that by understanding the specific nature of the shortage, we can then hope to provide a remedy."
A program to reduce the number of open I/T jobs at Purdue University: an industry case study,Julie R. Mariga,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371212,"The number of unfilled information technology (IT) positions in demand in the United States is estimated at 1.6 million this year. The demand for skilled IT people far exceeds the supply and it is estimated that half of the 1.6 million positions will likely remain vacant. Due to the shortage of skilled I/T professionals, companies and universities have to be creative and develop in-house programs that will allow them to produce their own IT professionals from among a pool of employees working in non-technical areas or possessing non-technical degrees. Purdue University has developed such a program that will help fill open computing positions by providing people with a solid educational foundation as well as current technical skills. This paper discusses the program Purdue has put into place to help overcome its shortage of qualified I/T professionals."

The effect of rapid IT change on the demand for training,John Skip Bernamati,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371214,"Information technology is rapidly changing. This increases the complexity of IT management. Research has yet to explain the IT management problems due to such change. The current study developed a survey instrument about such problems based on experiences described in structured interviews with 16 IT professionals. The instrument was mailed to a nationwide sample of 1,000 IT professionals. Two hundred forty-six provided useable data. The research identified five of problems of rapid IT change, namely Vendor Competitiveness, Poor Quality, Incompatibility, Management Confusion, and Training Demands. It confirmed a model suggesting that increased Vendor Competitiveness leads to Poor Quality, Incompatibility, and Management Confusion, and that these increase Training Demands. The research also offers suggestions for future investigation of the problems and a potential instrument with which to conduct it."
The quality of managerial training in telecommunications: a comparison of the marketing and information systems managers' viewpoints,Karen Ketler,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371215,"This paper compares the results of two studies - the first study targeted the marketing manager while the information systems (IS) managers were the focus of the second study. Both studies questioned the respondents about the quality of their training in thirty telecommunications issues. What was most surprising was the total dissatisfaction with the training in telecommunications voiced by both the marketing and IS managers. The marketing managers did not rate their training on even one issue as average or above. Only one issue, Local Area Networks (LAN), was rated as average or above average in the quality of their training by the IS managers. Training in the currently used applications was rated the highest while training in the advanced or emerging applications was rated the lowest. When these applications are used innovatively, an organization can capture a strategic advantage. Self-study, organizational programs, educational institutions and professional agencies were the primary sources of the training. Training programs provided by professional agencies were rated the highest in quality while the organizational in-house programs were rated the weakest."
A view from the entry level: student perceptions of critical information systems job attributes,Tim Goles,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371216,"Globalization and the expanding digital nature of today's business environment have resulted in skyrocketing demand for qualified IT personnel. Organizations are increasingly turning to recently graduated IS students as a critical source of supply. In light of this, the objective of this paper is to identify the relative importance of job attributes considered by IS students when evaluating a job. Drawing on content motivation as a general theoretical foundation, this paper surveyed 243 IS students at two large southwestern universities to determine what job attributes they find most appealing when assessing potential positions and organizations. Prior research was aggregated to compile a comprehensive list of job attributes. Two methods were used by respondents to evaluate these attributes; rank ordering, and points allocation (weighted measure). The results provide insight into the relative importance that IS students attach to specific job attributes. This information may be used by organizations to provide relevant information to potential employees, resulting in improved alignment between employee preferences and organizational reality, with a subsequent effect on job attitude and turnover."
m-powering personnel for e-business change,Colin Ash,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371217,"The paper examines a model that proposes various antecedents to successful e-business change management in ERP environments. A case study of an m-commerce project for a personnel management system within a large traditional engineering company is described in the context of this model. The specific goal of the research is to determine facilitators that lead to e-business project success of these change efforts. The results show that performance gains from the Intranet-ERP project were accompanied by the presences of facilitators in all dimensions of the framework. Of particular importance were those components related to employee empowerment â knowledge management, relationship building, and learning capacity. This has implications for both IT and user personnel and the future governance of the organisation."
Self esteem: moderator between role stress fit and satisfaction and commitment?,Anthony C.

Furthermore, this research seeks to determine if self-esteem moderates the relationship between satisfying employee preferences and levels of satisfaction and commitment. Preliminary findings supported these propositions."
Satisfaction of IT professionals with employment arrangements in traditional and virtual contexts,Thomas W. Ferratt,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371219,"Retention of IT personnel is a difficulty encountered by many organizations today, particularly for those who work in virtual organization contexts. However, the fit between IT employees' preferred work arrangements and their current work arrangements and this fit's impact on IT employees' intention to stay has been an under-researched phenomenon. This paper develops a conceptual framework, based on Rousseau's [38] psychological contract theory, to address the retention concern. Additional literatures that enhance the conceptual framework suggest that the antecedents of fit, besides preferred employment arrangement, include IT employee stages and anchors, IT competencies, and organizational factors, including IT human resource practices. IT human resource strategy, in turn, impacts the organizational factors. The conceptual framework incorporates additional antecedents of intention to stay, including other employment opportunities, virtual team factors, and individual factors. The paper also suggests an initial empirical study to explore the concept of fit and its antecedents as an initial point of departure for the examination of the conceptual model."

We provide an industry case study of a firm with a normally high IT workload, overloaded in 1998 with three additional large-scale IT projects. Simultaneously, the firm experienced its highest IT staff turnover in recent years. The firm undertook a four-part research study and analysis or its problems. A balanced program was implemented based on the results of the study, focusing on interesting and challenging work, working environment and compensation. IT retention increased dramatically from a low of 76% in September 1998 to 84% in late 1998 to 98% in most of 1999, Key business imperatives are proceeding on schedule, new work is being managed, and IT's contribution has become a recognized success factor for the company as a whole."
"Industry perceptions of the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed by computer programmers",Janet L. Bailey,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371221,"In a day and age where computer information systems permeate virtually every facet of society, organizations find it difficult to hire adequate numbers of computer personnel. Judging by the number of `quick-fix' organizations that offer training in âweeks rather than yearsâ and the number of individuals that each claims to train per year, the shortage would seem to come from a lack of adequate skills rather than a lack of applicants. This paper reports the findings of an study designed to identify the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) needed by one group of information technology (IT) personnel â the computer programmer."
"IT skills portfolio research in SIGCPR proceedings: analysis, synthesis and proposals",Makoto Nakayama,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371222,"This paper provides an analysis on information technology (IT) skills portfolio issues from the perspective of firms. The motivation behind this study was our observation that firms are having increasing difficulty in determining their optimal skills portfolio and in acquiring and managing that portfolio in turbulent times. Because a shortage of skilled IT professionals with has been a common theme from the early days of computing, we believe that an analysis of past work using the skills portfolio perspective gives us insights into the gaps where future IS research can illuminate this area. First, the paper reviews 102 IT skills portfolio related papers that appeared in the SIGCPR proceedings between 1985 and 2000. Then the thesis of these papers are summarized and classified according to what skills portfolio firms look for and how they acquire and maintain skills. Particular attention is paid to the gaps in the research to date. Finally, a set of research issues and propositions are given based on the analysis."
Panel: Dimensions of mobility in the I.T. profession examining âTurnover Cultureâ and âStaying Behaviorâ (panel session),Michael J. Gallivan,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371223,"This panel is designed to examine various dimensions of mobility among IT professionals. Turnover rates for IT professionals have risen from the traditional 6-10% to approximately 20% industry-wide (Maddern, 2000) and 25-35% in Fortune 500 companies (Agarwal & Ferratt, 1999). Fortune magazine recently noted that quitting in the technology profession has become literally an annual event, as the average job tenure in IT has shrunk to about 13 months (Daniels & Vinzant, 2000). Quite simply, this has to hurt. Corporate efforts to utilize technology to strategic advantage are often hampered in firms experiencing such high turnover. When IT professionals leave their employers, specialized skills, tacit knowledge, and understanding of specific business operations and systems often depart too. This can be a punch to the gut of an organization â sometimes a single powerful punch when a key âfranchise playerâ is lost, or a constant pummeling inflicted by a steady exodus of IT professionals."
Breaking and entering the male domain. Women in the IT industry,Liisa A. von Hellens,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371535,"Interviews with Australian IT professionals (twenty-two women and two men) working in technical areas are referenced to explore how the masculinity of the IT industry is perceived by women working as IT professionals. The skills the interviewees see as important for success in this industry and which have helped them to pursue a satisfactory and fulfilling career are also discussed. Mentoring is suggested as a means of changing young women's negative perceptions or IT as a career, in order to improve female participation in IT education and the IT industry."
Gender differences in IS career choice: examine the role of attitudes and social norms in selecting IS profession,K. D. Joshi,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371224,"The proposed research will systematically assess the causes of gender-related differences in attraction to information systems (IS) as a career. We propose a Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA)âbased model of intention to pursue an IS career which incorporates work value congruence, attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy. Undergraduate students in an introductory IS course, which for many will be their first introduction to the field, will be surveyed to test this model and also the extent to which their perceptions change with exposure to IS through the course."

How long will they stay? Predicting an IT professional's preferred employment duration,Ritu Agarwal,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371226,"Agarwal and Ferratt [3] describe a theory of the staying behavior of IT professionals, which combines individual- and organizational- centric views. Their theory, drawing upon Rousseau's [24] conception of psychological contracts, proposes that a critical antecedent of staying behavior is an IT professional's preferred employment duration. The purpose of the research-in-progress described in this paper is to build upon their work by further examining the antecedents of this construct We argue that preferred employment duration is jointly determined by career anchor, life stage, and competencies of the IT professional, with the type of the employing organization serving as a potentially moderating factor. The paper presents the model and describes the conceptual underpinnings for each of its various constructs and relationships. We also briefly discuss a two-phased empirical study to investigate the model."

The paper will address the responses of corporate partners, students, and the university faculty with respect to the recruitment and retention of IT professionals, skill and knowledge requirements for IT personnel, the factors important to MIS graduates in selecting career opportunities, the impact of commercial off-the-shelf software on IT skill requirements, and IT compensation strategies."
Retaining IS talents in the new millennium: effects of socialization on IS professionals' role adjustment and organizational attachment,Ruth C. King,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371228,"This study examined the effects of six organizational socialization tactics on new information systems (IS) professionals' role adjustment and organizational attachment. Data were collected from 187 newly hired IS professionals. The results showed that the six socialization tactics affected new IS professionals differently. Investiture tactics affected directly all the variables studied except role ambiguity. Serial tactics had a direct and positive effect on continuance commitment but a negative effect on intention to quit. Both sequential and collective tactics had direct effects on role ambiguity. Overall, the social aspects of the socialization process had the most significant effects on new IS professionals' role adjustment and organizational attachment. The results suggest that organizational socialization is an important strategy that needs to be considered in both IS research and practice."

Exploring the inputs of IS service,Janette Moody,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371230,"The importance of an IS unit's level of service to its internal customers (i.e., end-users) is well recognized (Kettinger and Lee, 1994; Pitt, Watson and Kavan, 1995; Kang and Bradley, 1999). In fact, the level of service provided by the IS unit to its internal customers can ultimately impact the organization's level of service to its external customers, as the IS unit contributes to the overall organizational climate for service (Schneider, White, and Paul, 1998). Much of the research on IS service quality has focused on the gap that exists between end-user expectations for the service and perceptions of the actual service received. Therefore, while these studies have contributed to the measurement of the IS unit's service (i.e., outputs), they have not looked closely at the service providers themselves (i.e., inputs). This research project focuses on the inputs."
A survey of system administrator mental models and situation awareness,Dennis G. Hrebec,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371231,"Little empirical research has been conducted on the mental models and situation awareness of system administrators. To begin addressing this deficiency, a short survey was prepared and broadcast to system administrators via Internet newsgroups. Fifty-four sysadmins responded. These respondents indicated that there is much about the systems they oversee that they don't understand, and the more they do not understand about their systems, the more likely they are to attribute this ignorance to hardware, and not software, unknowns. The respondents attribute little of the expertise they do possess to formal education or training. Further, when faced with a novel situation, the respondents were more likely to rely on themselves and their personal contacts than on the system's manufacturers, or on third party support. However, the more the sysadmins attributed their ignorance of their systems to hardware unknowns, the more likely they were to rely on manufacturer and third party support. Compared to Microsoft oriented sysadmins, Unix oriented sysadmins were more likely to attribute their expertise to working with others, and were more likely to attribute their ignorance to hardware unknowns. Finally, respondents who felt that their organizational superiors understood what is involved in system administration were more likely to perceive these superiors as providing the sysadmins with adequate support."
Measuring participants' perception on facilitation in group support systems meetings,Gert-Jan de Vreede,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371232,"Facilitation is often considered to be one of the key factors in the successful application of Group Support Systems. Research on GSS facilitation has revealed insight into the types of tasks performed by facilitators and the potential positive effects of facilitation on group consensus and satisfaction. However, earlier research has hardly approached GSS facilitation from the participants' point of view. This paper presents a study in which a questionnaire was developed and distributed to 182 participants of facilitated GSS meeting in order to measure their perception on various facilitation tasks. The results suggested three categories of facilitation tasks that are perceived important by participants. Each of these categories strongly correlated with participants' meeting satisfaction. Further research is needed to refine these categories so that the instrument may be used to evaluate a facilitator's performance."

Research in progress: the effects of ethical climate on attitudes and behaviors toward software piracy,Diane Lending,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371235,"Software piracy, the unauthorized copying of computer software, is widespread in many organizations today. From the perspective of managers in organizations, software piracy means the threat of costly litigation on the one hand, balanced against the reduced expense for additional software if unauthorized copies are used. It should be possible to exercise more effective control over software piracy with a more complete understanding of the factors that lead to the decision to copy software. The goal of this study is to assess the direct and moderating effects of the organization's ethical climate on a variety of attitudes and behaviors regarding software piracy. Prior research on software piracy has tended to focus on individual factors that influence piracy. This study is part of a multi-year, multi-university study of software piracy. Results from our prior studies suggest that while individual factors such as age and gender influence piracy attitudes and behaviors, these effects appear to be overshadowed by organization effects. In this study, we measure organization ethical climate as perceived by students in three universities and their attitudes and behaviors towards software piracy. The measures of ethical climate used in the literature have been modified to fit the university setting."
Nerd Work: attractors and barriers perceived by students entering the IT field,Martha E. Myers,"April 2001,",https://doi.org/10.1145/371209.371236,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors that attract as well as discourage students who display an initial interest in IT careers. Factors influencing students one way or the other may include media images of IT, role models, gender, and age. The study proposes to investigate these factors by focusing on the first programming course that is standard in many IT curricula. Demographic factors of students who enroll and either withdraw, pass, or fail the course will be analyzed, and then the same students will be surveyed to examine in greater depth their perceptions, both negative and positive, about IT careers and IT professionals. The results will provide educators and practitioners with information about myths that students hold that need to be dispelled, as well as the possible need to convey more realistic perspectives on the breadth and variety of IT jobs. Identification of these factors can help in recruiting as well as retaining a greater number of qualified students and ultimately increasing the supply of qualified IT workers."
Preparing the information technology workforce for the new millennium,Janet L. Bailey,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333336,"In an era when information technology (IT) is an integral part of society, many organizations are finding it difficult to hire adequate numbers of information technology personnel. Computer systems have permeated virtually every facet of organizations, creating a demand for individuals with IT skills at every level. The situation is complicated by the fact that finding personnel with the appropiate skills mix is even more problematic. As we move into the new millennium, IT roles are shifting at a rapidly increasing pace. Technical skills alone are no longer sufficient for success in the IT profession â soft skills like communication, problem solving, and teamwork are increasingly important. Recognizing that no curriculum can provide all training needed by every employee in every position, the issue then becomes to identify which specific sets of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) are most important to IT organizations. This paper presents the findings of an initial case study undertaken to indentify the necessary KSAs that can be used in the development of academic and industry training programs."
Hollywood: a business model for the future?,Charles E.

The theory was developed during a study of rapidly growing enterprises in the new media industry sponsored by CommerceNet in Los Angeles during 1998-99. Following an outline of this organizational model, the paper reports an in-depth case study of a on-going successful business concern which has been built upon the principles of this âHollywoodâ model of information technology enabled firms and whose leadership espouses the role of `producer'. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of how this new organizational model can be implemented and how work process can be shifted from a task oriented project base to a community team basis for new ecommerce organizations."
Roadmap for successful information technology transfer for small businesses,Mike Chesher,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333338,"It is recognised that information and communications technologies (ICT) have the potential to radically transform company operations [4], particularly when the company belongs to the set of small/medium enterprises (SMEs) [9]. However, one of the major obstacles in effecting a successful transformation is the lack of knowledge, on the part of SME management and staff, regarding the best way to undertake the transformation. This knowledge is becoming harder to acquire, particularly in the fast moving electronic commerce sector [4], [7], [8], [10]."
The emerging it group and rapid IT change,John âSkipâ Benamati,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333340,"Information technology (IT) changes rapidly. This increases the complexity of IT management. In response, many organizations create a formal group of IT professionals to evaluate emerging IT and thus cope with its change. A survey based on structured interviews was mailed to a nationwide sample of 1,000 IT organizations. Two hundred forty-six respondents provided data to identify categories of coping mechanisms to handle changing IT. Five categories emerged, namely, Education and Training, Internal Procedures, Vendor Support, Consultant Support, and Endurance. Organizations with a group dedicated to investigating emerging IT cope more extensively (p < .01), but not more successfully than do those without one."
Integration of IT into the school curricula: perceptions of kindergarden to highschool (K-12) teachers,Conrad Shayo,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333346,"Computer use in schools is still low compared to use in other sectors of the economy. Recent surveys have found that even in schools on the leading edge in computer use, slightly less than half (42%) of the teachers use computers for instruction. This pilot study investigates the perceptions of K-12 teachers with respect to the integration of computers into the school curricula. The study is important given the recent efforts by federal, state and local governments to stimulate the use of computers in schools. A total of 1280 teachers from a South Western USA school district participated in the survey. Preliminary analyses show that causes of non-integration of computers in the school curricula are not solely determined by individual or software characteristics but the result of interaction between individual, software, and school environment characteristics. The findings confirm interactionist theories of resistance of change."
Training e-commerce support personnel for enterprises through action learning,Kam Hou Vat,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333351,"This paper describes an ongoing campus-based training experiment based on the Action Learning concept [24] to expose to undergraduate students majoring in Software Engineering, the increasing globalization of electronic commerce, so as to enable them to see through the quality required of today's Information and Communications Technologists (ICT). The experiment recruits students on a voluntary basis and covers training in the areas of WWW-based application development, and case studies of business models in electronic commerce. It is also expected that this experiment will lead to the development of special interest groups of students in the different technological and business aspects of the Internet-based organizations."
Modeling personnel and roles for electronic commerce retail,Simon Fong,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333354,"Most of the electronic commerce businesses have to address the same issues such as the four core business activities namely Attract, Interact, Act and React. The success of an E-Commerce business hinges on how competent the personnel who operate the four activities are. In this paper, we identify the job functions of the personnel for a typical Internet retail. In particular, we present an object-oriented model of the personnel specialized for Internet-based retail business. The model is designed according to the four core business activities. The personnel are designed to support the fundamental functions that make a successful E-Commerce business. Our model can serve as a high-level infrastructure planning or ERP for Internet retail, and it can be modified to suit other E-commerce domains such as Business-to-Business commerce."
Examining workgroup influence on technology usage: a community of practice perspective,Michael J. Gallivan,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333356,"This paper develops a new theoretical model with which to examine the factors that determine employees' technology usage within organizational settings. Much of the prior IS training literature has assumed an underlying relationship between necessary conditions for technology adoption â such as user training and support resources â and actual technology use. Whereas these âfacilitating conditionsâ for technology usage [38, 80, 81] have been taken for granted as factors that influence system adoption and usage, the reality of learning and working in organizational settings suggests an entirely different mode of influence on employees' technology-related behavior. Drawing from research in cognitive anthropology [35], and acknowledging the role of communities of practice that shape learning, behavior, and memory [5, 65, 87, 88], we develop an alternative theoretical framework to explain employees' adoption of technology and their degree of system usage. Contrasting this novel theoretical framework with traditional notions that presume technology usage to be directly related to the amount or perceived quality of user training and support, we evaluate both frameworks with empirical data obtained from a technology implementation initiative across five sites of one nonprofit organization. While both theories receive some support from our data, we argue for the recognition that social influences exert an effect not just on whether employees adopt IT [77], but more importantly on how and how much employees use technology for their jobs. Implications for research and practice related to IT training are provided, as well as to more general lessons for managing technology implementation."
Computer personnel research: what have we learned in this decade?,Fred Niederman,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333357,This paper presents the results of quantitative and qualitative analysis of the prior 9 years of SIGCPR proceedings.

Theory and models for creating engaging and immersive ecommerce Websites,Morgan Jennings,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333358,"The purpose of this paper is to describe theory and research from several disciplines, not generally understood by web developers, which the author believes are applicable to creating engaging and immersive ecommerce environments. These disciplines include aesthetic experience (AE), Flow, landscape assessment, and a proposed aesthetic framework. The link between these different areas is aesthetics, specifically aesthetic experience. Developing ecommerce sites based on models related to aesthetics can provide an organized means of designing engaging and immersive sites which are more likely to lead to positive user experience. IT personnel commonly understand the psychological aspects of human-computer interaction (HCI). Similarly, the toolbox of every web designer and Internet system architect should include knowledge of the concepts related to engaging and immersive environments."
The nature of end-user relationships in the development of electronic commerce applications,A. C. Leonard,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333360,"The effectiveness of IT departments, and more specifically the developers of electronic commerce (EC) applications, and the value they are adding to their organizations in many cases are hampered by poor relationships between EC professionals and their end users. This situation impacts on EC professionals' ability to produce service and support of high quality that delivers competitive advantage for the company in the electronic commerce environment. This paper looks into the working relationship between EC developers and its end users. It describes EC-end user relationships as intriguing and complex and that these relationships should be seen and managed as multidimensional entities. Two such dimensions, namely the physical and abstract dimensions which form the basis of EC-end user relationships, enable one to fully describe the holistic nature of such relationships and encapsulate the important elements of a support-oriented organization, namely mutuality, belonging, and connection."

For organizations to become truly âvirtualâ they need to move to alternative work arrangements including to telework."
Use and perceived value of computer-based information systems in supporting the decision making of German managers,George E. Vlahos,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333365,"This study surveyed a sample of German managers to investigate the amount of information technology (IT) these managers used and their perceived value and satisfaction with their existing computer-based information systems (CBIS) in providing helpful information for making successful and effective decisions. A detailed analysis of the responses produced the following findings: (1) The German sample of managers was predominantly male, older, had several college computer courses, and was comprised mainly of middle and top level managers. (2) The German managers used IT rather heavily, approximately 10 hours per week. This result was similar to those reported in several previous studies. (3) First-line managers were the heaviest users of IT and perceived the greatest value of CBIS for decision making. Top level managers were the lightest users of IT but perceived greater value of CBIS than middle managers. From the functional areas, managers in information systems and accounting/finance were the heaviest users of IT and perceived the greatest value of CBIS. For the overall sample, there was a significant correlation between amount of use of IT and perceived value of CBIS. (4) The majority of the respondents were confident that the information they were getting from their CBIS was not compromised due to lack of adequate security. (5) About half of the responding managers reported that they helped specify more than sixty percent (60%) of the content or format of the information presented to them by CBIS. (6) Eighty four percent (84%) of the respondents rated their corporation's amount of investment in IT to support managerial needs as adequate or better."
Enticing online consumers: a technology acceptance perspective research-in-progress,Lei-da Chen,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333368,"Business-to-consumer aspect of electronic commerce (EC) is the most visible business use of the World Wide Web (WWW). A virtual store, simply stated, is âa storefront in cyberspace, a place where customers can shop from their home computers and where merchants can offer merchandise and services for a fraction of the overhead required in a physical storefrontâ [33]. It allows companies to offer direct sales to their customers through an electronic channel [17]. The fundamental problem motivating this research study is that in order for a virtual store to compete effectively with both physical stores and other online retailers, there is an urgent need to understand the factors that entice consumers to use a virtual store. This research aims to provide both theoretical and empirical analysis to explain consumers' use of a virtual store and its antecedents. By applying the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this research takes a technology acceptance perspective to examine consumer behavior in virtual store context. The data from a survey of online consumers are used to empirically test the proposed research model. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is performed to examine the reliability and validity of the measurement model, and structure equation modeling (SEM) technique is used to evaluate the causal model. The implication of the research model to both researchers and practitioners is also discussed."
The employees' side of IS (panel session),Maung K. Sein,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333370,"The IS literature has almost always taken the perspective of the organization in addressing research issues. When we as researchers study productivity, benefits and competitive advantage, we almost always mean the benefits that accrue to the organization. Even such approaches as Socio-Technical systems and quality of work life have a decidedly company leaning. It is to the company's benefit that productivity etc. increase. Often, we go up one level and look at societal issues. What is left mostly untouched is the employees' side. What benefits do they get?

Awad,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333375,"In this paper, we explore the status of e-commerce in the banking industry. A random sample of 43 commercial Virginia bank Web sites were evaluated to determine the level of e-commerce involvement and the potential of e-commerce in banking. Preliminary results indicate a state of fragmentation in the quality, content, personalization, and category of Web sites, although more and more banks have demonstrated ready commitment to âpresenceâ on the Internet."
E-commerce organizational structure (extended abstract): an integration of four cases,Rebecca Grant,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333376,"In expanding into e-commerce, clicks and mortar companies have many options. They can outsource all of the e-commerce related activities to firms specializing in those tasks. They can bring in new employees with the required skills â either integrating them into work units with current employees or setting up new e-commerce units. They can retrain or redirect existing employees. Or they can combine these approaches."
"People, business and IT skills: the perspective of women in the IT industry",L. A. von Hellens,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333378,"This paper discusses professional women's perceptions of the skills required for working in the information technology (IT) industry with respect to the skills women bring to IT work and how the skills contribute to their career progression. The paper references interviews with ten women IT professionals who were asked to describe their entry into the IT industry, their perceptions of IT careers and the skills requirements for success. It was found that an ability to switch between different types of skills (people skills and technical skills) and to adapt to different IT environments contributed to the career progression of women in the IT industry. In the newer areas of IT such as electronic commerce, the ability to switch between one skill set to another is important for the success of such applications. It is suggested that the misrepresentation of the specialization available in the IT industry is an important factor contributing to the gender gap at higher managerial levels and it can only be closed if the range of skills, aptitudes and career paths are made clear to the women."
Retention and the career motives of IT professionals,Ritu Agarwal,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333384,"Motivated by organizational concerns related to the recruitment and retention of IT professionals, the objective of this paper is to develop and investigate an explanatory model of IT professionals' joining and staying/leaving behaviors. The underlying conceptual base for the model draws upon recent work on psychological contracts. A key dimension in this work is the preferred duration of the employment relationship. We elaborate the theory of psychological contracts with additional constructs representing an IT professional's career motives. In particular, our version of the theory suggests that, in addition to preferred length of the employment relationship, important individual factors that help form the psychological contract are the career stage of an individual and the individual's personal career anchor or orientation. Specific hypotheses related to the effects of these variables on staying/leaving behavior are presented. Empirical data gathered from a field study of 130 IT professionals were used to test the research hypotheses. Results indicate that the hypothesized variables exhibit significant effects on IT professionals' intentions to stay with their current employer. In addition, results point to directions where fruitful future research is warranted."
Skill requirements of IT&T professionals and graduates: an Australian study research-in-progress,Jo Orr,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333385,"The IT&T (Information Technology and Telecommunications) Skills Taskforce recently released the results of their study on IT&T skill requirements in Australia, predicting that in the current financial year, Australian employers will be seeking an excess of 30,000 skilled IT&T professionals [8]. This figure is expected to grow at approximately 9% per year for at least the next 5 years [8]. Yet already, employers are reported to be experiencing difficulty obtaining skilled IT&T personnel [8]."
Relationships between personal demographics and motivation of information technology professionals to participate in professional development research-in-progress,J. Ellis Blanton,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333387,"Modern organizations are increasingly dependent on information technology (IT) enabled business systems. Development of IT systems requires a competent IT professional (ITP) staff, however, organizations are hampered by a severe shortage of qualified ITPs. Government studies recommend retaining existing ITPs and establishing professional development programs to help them obtain and maintain desired competencies. Research from related disciplines indicate that over time technical workers participate less in professional development, but still little is known about the relationships between personal demographics and participation in professional development."
Information systems development: can there be âgoodâ conflict?,Kenneth J. Trimmer,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333389,"Successful information systems development (ISD) is a perennial concern of both practitioners and researchers. As the scope of ISD expands to provide enterprise-wide and web-based systems, the set of individuals in ISD includes many whose responsibilities and experiences cross organizational functions. The involvement of this diverse set of individuals in ISD can lead to increased levels of conflict within the development group. However, not all conflict is detrimental to organizational tasks. This paper presents conflict and the resulting conflict resolution as a facet of team development. Conflict can take two general forms. The first form of conflict, interpersonal, has a negative or dysfunctional impact on group tasks and relations, and can lead to turnoever. The second form, task conflict, has a positive impact on group tasks. The need for ISD teams to recognize different types of conflict and successfully resolve them is presented within the context of an overall model of team and systems development."
Risk factors in enterprise wide information management systems projects,Mary Sumner,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333392,"In the past several years many organizations have initiated enterprise-wide information management systems projects, using such packages as SAP, Peoplesoft, and Oracle. These projects often represent the single largest investment in an information systems project in the history of these companies, and in many cases the largest single investment in any corporate-wide project. These enterprise-wide information management systems projects bring about a host of new questions, because they represent a new type of management challenge. Some of these questions and issues are:"
Trust in systems development: a model of management and developer interaction research in progress,Mark A. Serva,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333395,"Systems analysis and design (SAD) is often considered to be a technical task; indeed, in many cases exposure to SAD at the college level is an extension of a programming and database management course. Most information systems (IS) professionals would agree, however, that SAD requires communication skills, management skills, and organizational skills in addition to analytical and technical abilities. Further complicating the social dynamics of the situation, many systems are now developed by outsourcing partners, who work with management in virtual team environments. The authors recently met with the CIO of a major financial services firm, who stated that âVendor management is the single most important skill â¦ (my) IS management teams need to developâ. This research presents a theoretical framework for examining the relationship between management and systems developers, in particular applying a model of trust to explain behaviors from both party's perspectives. In addition, this research tests that framework within the context of a controlled setting."
Understanding the link between IT project manager skills and project success research in progress,Nicole Haggerty,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333398,"Success in information systems project implementations remains an elusive goal for many organizations. One factor contributing to project outcomes is the skills employed by the IT project manager. This study develops a literature based model which seeks to describe the link between IT project managers skills and IT project success. Specifically, IT project managers skills are categorized as business competence, technical competence and relationship competence. The research model proposes that the IT project manager's use of these skills (both level and type of skill) results in different project outcomes. Project success is assessed by way of different perceptual measures as reported by the project manager. Pretest results are favorable and indicate an opportunity to advance our understanding of IT project implementation success factors and the role that IT project management skills play in that outcome. Selection of a pilot site is underway so that phase two of this three phase research program can continue."
Teaching electronic commerce (panel session),Malu Roldan,"April 2000,",https://doi.org/10.1145/333334.333401,"This panel will discuss various approaches and issues pertaining to the development and implementation of courses in Electronic Commerce â at the undergraduate, graduate, and executive levels. There has never been a better time to be teaching e-commerce. Web applications have evolved to a point where Gilder's âhollowing out the computerâ seems almost achievable â as dot-com companies eager to build market share provide essential tools for the price of an eyeball (multiplied by the size of your outlook address book). The same toolbox that is creating an exciting and accessible platform for building e-businesses can be used to build the e-commerce classes that introduce students to such endeavors. This situation makes it possible to augment local school platforms to design rich, portable e-commerce classes that teach students the fundamentals of e-business as well as empower them to stretch the definition of this evolving phenomenon."

Information technology alignment or âfitâ in highly turbulent environments: the concept of flexibility,Kathleen Knoll,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186286,"Most information technology (IT) âfitâ literature has taken a structural contingency approach to studying the alignment of IT to organizational characteristics. The research has focused on internal fit, and assumed placid and stable environments. External fit is likely to be more important than internal fit for firms operating in highly dynamic environments. The concept of flexibility is introduced as a form of alignment in turbulent environments. Our definition of flexibility (based on work in IT, manufacturing, strategic management, and living systems theory) identifies three types of flexibility: flexibility in functionality, in use, and in modification. Twenty dimensions of IT flexibility help illustrate some possible measures. We conclude by discussing what our dimensions reveal about flexibility in the client/server domain."

Justifying the information technology budget within changing environments,C. Francalanci,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186290,"The paper analyzes the relationship between business performance and investments in information technologies. The present economic crisis is shouting unprecedented defiances not only at firms, but also at CIO (Chief Information Officers) and IS professionals in general: big companies are determined on cutting down the IT expense, both in absolute and related to the revenue and it is difficult for the CIO to ask top executives for further investments and even to justify the current levels of expense. In this context, the ex ante justification of single IT investments does not represent a solution to the ex ante economic justification of the IT budget: firms are interested in measuring economic and organizational results of the overall effects of IT investments. Therefore, the research is conducted by investigating the correlation between the aggregate annual expense in information technology and two indexes of firm performance, that are defined and justified in the paper. Results of experimentation conducted on the business data collected by the MIP-Nolan Norton Observatory are presented. Trends confirming theoretical hypotheses are illustrated and possible causes motivating opposite trends are discussed."
Employment structures of information systems professionals: a comparative study of the United States and Singapore,Sandra Slaughter,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186292,"Prior research into information systems (IS) personnel has been primarily directed from the perspective of an internal labor market. The assumption underlying that body of research is that agents, i.e., IS workers, form long-term employment relationships with the principals, i.e., the firms employing. However, the recent emphasis on externalizing IS labor (for example, by outsourcing) suggests that this assumption may no longer hold true. This study provides an empirical investigation of the extent of externalizing IS workers in both the United States and Singapore. Results indicate that the United States utilizes more externalized IS employment structures than Singapore. Moreover, the trend toward externalized IS workers is more pronounced in the United States in the most recent three quarters analyzed than at any other period in the 1990â1993 timeframe. Possible explanations for the differential trend behavior ensue."
The career outlooks of I/S professionals,Ephraim R. McLean,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186293,"This follow-up study contrasted the pre-graduation and post-employment job characteristic preferences vs. realities of a sample of 290 I/S professionals. The preference-reality job characteristic discrepancies, job and career attitudes at follow-up, and two moderating variables (I/S salary level and length of I/S employment) became the independent variables in a multiple regression equation with present and long-term I/S career outlook as the dependent variables. The 16 independent variables had a significant impact on both present and long-term I/S career outlook (p < .00001). The reality shock experienced by entering I/S professionals and its impact on career outlook are discussed."
HRM practices in information technology management,Ernest Jordan,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186295,"This paper concerns the specific problem of the critical levels of staff turnover in the information technology (IT) area in Hong Kong. The aim is to give advice to improve the management of IT personnel. IT management practices are compared with theories from human resource management. As the theories are mostly developed in a Western context, a grounded approach has been taken. An in-depth study of programmers and analyst programmers in Hong Kong was carried out at the time of a crisis in labour turnover. The level of crisis enabled this study to find underlying factors that may normally be more hidden. A low level of attachment to the organisation was found, with stronger ties towards the profession and professional development. There was also an apparent difference in the attitudes and practices of group work."
Changes in the management of the information systems organization: an exploratory study,Michael J. Gallivan,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186296,"The present study was conducted as exploratory research to understand the activities and beliefs of IS and line managers, with regard to the management of information technology (IT). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 managers in seven firms to understand their current initiatives, future vision, and the factors driving change. Managers from three different positions from each company were interviewedâa senior IS manager, an IS application development manager, and a line manager. The results showed that there were a variety of different initiatives underwayâwith the most common ones being rapid prototyping, an emphasis on purchasing packages, business reengineering, and building IT infrastructure. Beyond these few commonalities, different firms were adopting a variety of changes to their IS organization structure, working relationships with users and outside vendors, system development tools and methodologies, and their training and other human resource policies."
Growing pains in information systems: transforming the IS organization for client/server development,William D. Nance,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186297,"Information systems (IS) groups are under increasing pressure to contribute to organizational performance and to support, or even drive, broad organizational transformation efforts through the successful exploitation of information technology (IT). Using a âsociocentricâ model of organizational work, this paper analyzes the experiences of one company's IS group that recently embarked on a long-term, enterprise-wide client/server system development initiative designed to transform organizational decision support processes. Even though the client/server initiative is still in its infancy and has not yet delivered high-impact applications, it has brought about substantial changes in the nature of work in the IS group. These changes range from new philosophies, methodologies, and technologies to shifts in the skills, communication patterns, and control structures required to develop and manage information systems."
The practice of business process reengineering: radical planning and incremental implementation in an IS organization,Michael Albers,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186298,"Business process reengineering has been proposed as a viable methodology whenever a radical shift in the way an organization performs its functions is desired. However, implementing the outcomes of a business process reengineering effort, viz., a new process, is no easy matter. This is especially true when an organization is uncertain of the potential of the new process and is also resource constrained. Nevertheless, a lack of commitment to quickly implement new process designs does not diminish the value an organization gains from such a critical examination of current practices. In this paper we argue that business process reengineering ought to be regarded as a radical, administrative, process-oriented organizational innovation. We present the approach taken by an IS organization to reengineer one of its key business processesâchange managementâand the issues and challenges that surfaced during the reengineering exercise. Although the suggestions for process redesign generated represented a radical departure from existing practice, the organization has elected to implement the ideas in an incremental fashion. The implementation strategy is examined in light of the nature of the innovation signified by business process reengineering."
Conceptual modelling in the hypermedia development process,Jana Dospisil,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186299,"This paper explores the potential of using multiple software requirements specification methods for elicitation of concepts in the development of university courseware based on the multimedia and hypermedia technology. At universities, the use of hypermedia and multimedia technology is perceived as one of the most efficient ways to enhance student access to information and improve learning interaction in the undergraduate computer science course. Such an approach will guarantee high level quality teaching whilst permitting significant reduction in lecturer-student contact hours. The process which plays the critical role in such a development environment is the concepts acquisition and requirements specification, collectively called requirements engineering."
Resolving cognitive conflict in requirements definition: a blackboard-based model and system architecture,Jeff Butterfield,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186300,Many IS managers consider requirements definition to be one of the most difficult phases in a system analysis and design project. It is also felt that no other phase contributes as much to the potential success or failure of the final product. One of the reasons that a successful requirements analysis is so elusive is because the information needed for an accurate solution is distributed among the individual designers and domain experts that comprise the design team.
IT in legal practice: research in progress,Leo van der Wees,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186301,"Information technology (IT) offers possibilities for legal practitioners not only as an aid in administrative processes but also for legal tasks. The former have been gradually automated particularly in larger firms but automation regarding the latter is still uncommon. Nevertheless, law firms could take advantage of their late start."
Practice makes use: using information technologies before implementation and the effect on acceptance by end users,William A. Kleintop,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186308,"This paper reports the results of a study on the effects of practice, a form of on the job training, on the pre-implementation attitudes and on post-implementation use of an information technology. The successful use of information technologies by end users is dependent on many variables including training of end users. Providing support to workers by training them to use information technologies can have positive effects for the implementation process. Training may directly effect workers' attitudes toward the information technologies making it more likely that they will voluntarily and persistently use the technologies. This research found practice before implementation of an electronic mail system in a business setting to be the best predictor of end users' perceptions that the system was easy to use and useful. The results also showed practice to be the best predictor of actual use of the electronic mail system by end users after its implementation. By providing employees the opportunity to practice skills necessary to use information technologies, managers may be making an investment in training that provides high returns in use of information technologies."
A three dimensional view and research agenda for the study of transfer of skills gained from formal end-user software training,Conrad Shayo,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186310,"Software training research indicates that some end-users do not subsequently transfer learned skills to their jobs. Yet, money, time and effort continue to be invested in formal software training. The three dimensional view presented in this article demonstrates that although the reasons for non-transfer are sometimes caused by trainee characteristics, software features, training approaches, the social context of work, and by the interaction between the four, training research generally focuses only on trainee characteristics and training approaches. We identify goal matching as a method that can ensure that trainees are getting what they need from the training process. Using goal matching and more directed training sessions should enhance the ability of software trainers to account for more transfer of learning to the work place."
Graphical user interfaces and ease of use: some myths examined,Michael C. Zanino,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186313,"Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are on their way to becoming the most pervasive interface for desktop systems at least partly because of conventional wisdom about their ease of use. Such an assumption may have been kindled by vendors' claims about the inherent usability of such interfaces although previous research on the productivity gains from GUIs has yielded mixed results. This paper reports the results of a field study of 230 users of a popular GUI, Microsoft Corporation's Windows. The study examined Windows' ease of useâan important factor contributing to eventual productivity. The results indicate that contrary to popular belief GUIs are not universally easy to useâcertain types of individuals are likely to find them easier to use than others. Organizational roles and management initiatives can also influence perceptions of ease of use. The findings also suggest that ease of use is enhanced through opportunities for self training rather than traditional, formal training."
Anticipated benefits of new information systems: the role of the proposer,Rajesh Mirani,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186314,"The assessment of the anticipated benefits of new information systems is important to the process of information system planning. A study of the anticipated benefits of 178 projects revealed nine benefits factors: improved information, strategic advantage, return on investment, reduced technology cost, better applications development, reduced travel costs, reduced workforce costs, business redesign, and adherence to government regulations."
Quality of information and the goals and targets of the organization,G. John van der Pijl,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186316,"In this paper a framework is presented for the ex-post evaluation of the quality of information in organizations. The framework brings together several approaches to quality that can be found in the literature, which however, offers no approach to the evaluation of the goal-related aspects of quality. Therefore such an approach is described in the second half of this paper."
Information systems and total quality management: establishing the link,Omar E. M. Khalil,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186318,"Many Total quality Management (TQM) implementations have failed to achieve the long-term, substantial gains promised by TQM proponents. Scholars and practitioners blame these failures on different causes which can be linked either directly or indirectly to insufficient support by information systems (IS) to TQM efforts. While IS is a key part of the infrastructure for TQM, its supporting role has not received much attention in the mostly prescriptive TQM literature. IS and TQM share a considerable degree of commonality in their end objectives and in their underlying philosophies and management systems. Their success hinges on the effective planning and implementation of each. This paper introduces a proposed framework to establish a link between the two. The two approaches appear to be entirely compatible and capable of being combined into a composite model of action for an organization seeking to maximize its competitive position."
Controlling systems development: effects on job satisfaction of systems professionals,Martin Santana,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186319,"While a great deal of organizational research has been devoted to the study of individual differences and task characteristics as the major determinants of job satisfaction, the role of organizational variables in explaining employee satisfaction has received little empirical attention. The present study argues that the extent to which employees perceive that their activities are controlled by managers, peers, or themselves may have significant effects upon their corresponding levels of job satisfaction. Based upon this rationale, this study investigated perceptions of different control approaches in relation to job satisfaction of 62 systems professionals of a local government organization. Bivariate analyses indicated that managerial control, team-member control, and self-control were highly correlated with general satisfaction. Additional analyses indicated that self-control had strong positive effects on both intrinsic and extrinsic satisfaction, while, managerial control had a strong positive effect on extrinsic satisfaction. Implications of the findings for the management of information systems personnel and future research are discussed."
Computer based systemsâtotal quality management and new organizational structures,F. A. Wilson,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186322,The increasing adoption of computer technology within service sector organizations has generated many studies of how effective use may be made of such systems. In this paper an analysis is made of one such implementation and an appraisal made of the way in which the interaction between the total quality management âphilosophyâ and computer based systems may evolve new forms of managerial structures and controls.
The impact of codes of ethics on information systems personnel,Susan J. Harrington,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186323,"This research looks at the impact of company codes of ethics, as well as codes of ethics written specifically for information systems (I.S.) employees. Moreover, since the intent of ethics codes is to clarify responsibility, the personality characteristics of denial of responsibility and its interaction with exposure to codes of ethics was examined. The impact of codes and the personality characteristic of denial of responsibility were measured based on I.S. judgments concerning illegal software copying, computer cracking (sometimes called hacking), spreading viruses, corporate sabotage using the computer, and computer fraud. Denial of responsibility was found to be related to a variety of computer abuses and did interact with company codes of ethics to influence attitudes toward viruses and computer fraud."
Skills in an environment of turbulence: a survey of information systems professionals in New Zealand,D. John Monin,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186325,"Based on a survey of 443 members of the New Zealand Computer Society, this study examines whether the skills requirements for information systems professionals have changed in the turbulent economic environment New Zealand has experienced during the last decade. Respondents to the questionnaire were asked to rate the importance of thirty-five skill items during the period they have been working under their present job designation. Although this exploratory study is not restricted to the last decade, the research expectations are that there has been a definite shift in the skills requirement. The focus is on the categorization of the skills as business-related or technology-related, this being the distinction traditionally accepted by most researchers to date. The results, however, of this study indicate a blurring of such a dichotomy, due possibly to a perception by the more experienced members of the profession that there has been a pronounced swing towards a requirement for more business-related skills. This research suggests a model to cater for this phenomenon, and a more comprehensive set of skill items for further research."
The structure of work perceptions among Hong Kong and United States IS professionals: a multidimensional scaling test of the Hofstede cultural paradigm,Norman B. Bryan,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186326,"Hong Kong and United States Information Specialist (IS) professionals' perceptions of work are analyzed according to Hofstede's cultural paradigm. More specifically, the theoretical emphasis of this research is a test of the cultural divergence hypothesis as it relates to the individualism/collectivism dimension of Hofstede's analysis. Further, smallest space analysis, a multidimensional scaling technique, is used to assess the differences between the two cultures. In general, the hypothesized differences between the two cultures is supported, Hong Kong and United States IS professionals differ along the affective facet of work perceptions. Implications of the findings are discussed."
Job expectations of IS professionals in Hong Kong,Janice M. Burn,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186327,"This paper reviews the job expectations of 200 IS professionals in Hong Kong, all of whom have entered the job market over the last 5 years with professional degree qualifications. The issues related to IS career development are explored in a worldwide context before they are specifically examined within the Hong Kong environment. A critical issue of concern for Hong Kong organizations is IS staff recruitment and retention. This is reflected by a growing commitment from Hong Kong tertiary institutes to develop academic programs which more closely support market needs."
Managing CASE introduction: beyond software process maturity,Lars Mathiassen,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186328,"Many software organizations face serious problems in their attempts to make expectations and realities meet in introduction of CASE technology. One promising and substantial approach to understand CASE introduction better and to provide guidelines for how to manage it more effectively has been developed by Watts S. Humphrey, Bill Curtis, and others. By relating CASE introduction to software process maturity they have provided a rich framework, both for analyzing and understanding the complexity of the implementation process, and for designing and managing specific implementation efforts."
Effects of participative management on the performance of software development teams,Woo Young Chung,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186330,"Researchers and practitioners advocate a participative management style for improving employee productivity and job satisfaction. Field studies have shown that participation has a modest, yet positive influence on productivity and job satisfaction. For software development teams, however, management approaches such as the notion of the chief programmer suggest that participation might not be productive. Systematic research has not been conducted to investigate the importance of a participative management style when managing software development teams. In this study we examine the relationship between software development team members' participative style and team performance."
Implementing microcomputers in local government: a case study of a loosely structured approach,John F. Sacco,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186332,"Microcomputers and microcomputer technology offer ample opportunity for improving the productivity, decision making, and work quality of government. However, if they are not adequately implemented, the opportunities are lost and resources wasted. One purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of a loosely structured implementation approach on various criteria of microcomputer success, including redundancy, opportunism, decision quality, and work quality. Another purpose is to determine whether the loosely structured approach is just a stage in a development toward a more structured strategy, or alternatively, whether the loosely structured technique is an enduring, workable method of implementation. Loosely structured connotes an approach that has both openness and rules, but favors individual choice over formal organizational rules and structure. The loosely structured approach is important to probe because it may be a default choice. It may be used because of lack of knowledge about traditional, formal methods of computer implementation. It may also be a forced, cost containment choice that relies mostly on endusers, supplemented by some professional systems analysis assistance. The research to investigate these issues is a longitudinal case study of a budget office in a large local government that started with a loosely structured style. The period covered included the years 1985 to 1992 with interviews taking place in 1988, 1990 and 1992."
The dimensions and correlates of systems development quality,T. Ravichandran,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186456,"The need to improve systems development quality is increasingly felt by information systems departments in organizations. A clear definition of systems development quality is required to focus quality management efforts. We develop a broader definition of quality by identifying product and process dimensions of quality that systems development should ensure, and present a framework to classify systems development quality metrics."
Personification of the computer: a pathological metaphor in IS,Nanette Monin,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186458,"Semantic and syntactic aspects of metaphor are explored and explained as a preface to an exposition of the impact on Information Systems (IS) personnel of a popular root metaphor: the personification of the computer. It is suggested that since action metaphors determine attitudes and future directions, this personification may be responsible for confusing both end-user and researcher: that if the potential of computers is to be more fully realised and utilised, our perceptions of the language in which we describe them should be illuminated. There is a danger, it is argued, that if human attributes are ascribed to the computer, personnel in IS begin to act out the metaphor pathologically."
Evaluating existing information systems from a business process perspective,Martin W. Mende,"April 1994,",https://doi.org/10.1145/186281.186459,"The evaluation of existing information systems has gained importance in information systems management. A research project involving ten major Swiss companies and the University of St. Gallen has developed a method for assessing existing system from a business process perspective. Systems are evaluated at two levels: the business process supported, and the technical and functional quality of the system. Users and business managers participate actively in the evaluation project. Evaluation criteria are derived using a critical success factor approach and a set of generally applicable factors. Measurement is considered central to the evaluation, and is supported by a set of generic measures and a catalogue of further measures. The evaluation aims at initiating improvement actions. The method has been tested successfully in the participating companies."

Information systems: educational offerings vs. industry needsâhow well do they match?,Judith A. Knapp,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158016,"This study describes relationships between educational institution and industry practices in the Information Systems area. It is based on the results of two surveys conducted in the Chicago metropolitan area. Each of the surveys was designed to answer specific questions related to curriculum issues and industry needs. In addition to the curriculum of choice, other specific areas of comparison are degrees, software, and hardware. Industry hiring practices and educational institutions' trends are also discussed. Industry and educational institutions appear to have similar expectations and should be encouraged to combine forces to achieve a common goal. The Information Systems students, who eventually become employees in industry, will benefit from each group's coordinated efforts."
The structure of job attitudes among entry-level I/S professionals: a path-analytic analysis,Ephraim R. McLean,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158117,"This paper reports on analyses done on data collected as part of an ongoing, longitudinal study of a national sample of information systems (I/S) professionals who have recently entered the work force. Path analysis, a form of structural equation modeling (SEM) used in exploratory studies where there is no definitive theory to be tested, was used to study the relationships among the subjects' demographics and their job preference and personal characteristics, and the characteristics of the I/S programs within the colleges and universities from which the subjects were recently graduated. The findings indicate that while young males from large, well-established I/S programs exhibit a good fit between their preferences and their work experiences, this is less true for others (i.e., females, older graduates, graduates from newer or small programs). The implications of these findings for management are discussed."
Identifying different paradigms for managing information technology,Sven J. Fischer,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158119,"Organizations are shaped based on a number of implicit and explicit assumptions. Usually, these assumptions are made by the founder of a company. Management of Information Technology (IT) is shaped in much the same way. It is based on several assumptions how to carry out information systems development, maintenance, information services, and how to plan for and control all these activities. Based on such assumptions, the authors identify four different approaches or paradigms to management of IT. A model is presented to position organizations in detail according to these paradigms. Potential ways of using the model are presented. Based on results of three types of empirical research, two ways of using the model are discussed in detail: the development of a necessary vision on the management of IT, and the identification of critical issues for the management of IT. The empirical results and the discussion of vision and critical issues lead to two major conclusions. First, there seemed to be no single goal to which IT organizations grow, i.e. all paradigms for managing IT were visible in practice. Second, although all paradigms were visible in practice, one paradigm, the paradigm of management control, dominated, despite the fact that for a lot of organizations this paradigm may not be the most obvious to rely upon. âJa mach' nur einen Plan!/ Sei nur ein grosses Licht!/ Und mach' dann noch'nen Zweiten Plan,/ Geh'n tun sie beide nichtâ (Bertold Brecht, Die Dreigroschenoper, Hofstede, 1978)."
Management of information technology innovation: a heuristic contingency paradigm research perspective,Mathew J.

The model integrates multiple and well-grounded theoretical streams of research."
Computer-based systems: a discussion of their application to managerial decision-support,Francis A. Wilson,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158124,"Much of the current work into developing computer-based systems (CBS) as aids for managerial decision-making within organizations, still explains system failures as a psychological or organizational problem, i.e. a problem of inadequate âacceptanceâ of the CBS by the intended user. From this, the conclusion is drawn that âmoreâ behavioural science research on user psychology can save the CBS-managerial decision-support concept. However, the underlying design ideal of CBS and the assumption of rational decision-making within organizations remains unquestioned. Any moves to question this ideal generally rest upon the issues of tool design in terms of providing alternative modes of information presentation in response to psychological âuser typesâ and problem categories."
Is the effectiveness of formal end-user software training a mirage?,Conrad Shayo,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158126,"Formal methods are perceived to play an important role in end-user software training and learning. However, evidence does not exist to support the effectiveness of formalized training on future use of the target software. This study uses qualitative research methods to explore the views of end-users with respect to the most recent formal software training session they attended. We use concepts from theories of self-regulation to generate questions and propositions that guide our analysis. Goals and intentions, self-efficacy and expectancy, individual characteristics, feedback and support were the subject of our questions. It was clear that pre-training goals were not matched with trainer goals, and that most trainees who adopted the software needed a second round of training before they began to use it on the job. Our interviewees provide recommendations for trainers, administrators, and software vendors with respect to software training. They advocate the need to establish training relevance early and ensure congruence of the goals of all the stakeholders. We discuss the findings and implications of the study and suggest areas for further study."
The interaction between end user computing and task characteristics: an exploratory study,Robert M. Barker,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158127,
AN is department dealing with end-user computing: a case study,Eelko K. R. E. Huizingh,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158128,"During the eighties end-user computing has rapidly grown and has become an irreversible phenomenon. Information Systems departments are facing a highly changed environment that calls for new strategies. Finding new strategies is even more important because not only the advantages of end-user computing are widely recognized, but end-user computing includes some potential organizational risks too. Trying to control end-user computing can easily be regarded as a frontal attack on employee productivity. Therefore, a well thought-out and carefully implemented strategy is required."
Job characteristic preference-reality discrepancies and the job and career attitudes of I/S professionals,Stanley J. Smits,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158130,A post-employment followup survey of I/S professionals was used to assess the characteristics of the respondents' present jobs and their career and job attitudes. Present job characteristics were compared to the job preferences expressed by the respondents prior to graduation. Significant preference-reality mean score differences were found for 15 of the 20 I/S job characteristics. Each respondent's preference-reality job characteristics discrepancy score was calculated and used in a series of multiple regression analyses as the independent variables with their job and career attitudes serving as the dependent variables. The results of the multiple regression analyses support the theoretical construct that attitudes are related to need fulfillment.
"Placement, performance and turnover of information systems professionals: implications for HRIS",Karen Ketler,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158132,"The purpose of this paper is to report the results of an empirical study of the placement and performance of 130 information systems professionals in a large utility company. Four distinct job environments were identified: 1) Centralized information systems department with technical focus, 2) Centralized information systems department with a user focus, 3) Decentralized information processing in the user departments with a technical focus, and 4) Decentralized information processing in the user departments with a user focus. The demands of each department were noted, and matched with the personality/education of the personnel. There was remarkable congruency between the demands of the position and the characteristics of the individuals. There was also statistical evidence that this congruency appears to improve performance."
Career paths in information systems: a longitudinal analysis,Jennifer L. Wagner,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158134,"Using data provided by the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972, individual careers of 405 persons in information systems (IS) professions were studied for the 1972-1986 period. The focus of this research is on identifying factors which influence the tenure of IS professionals. It provides some descriptive statistics as well as a description of a suitable statistical model and its estimation. Analysis of IS tenure using a failure time model allows the adjustment for right censoring and determination of those factors which seem to influence tenure. Wage level, starting age, and field of study (college major) were found to be significantly related to the tenure of IS professionals."
Factors that affect the adoption of distributed database management systems,Steven R. Gordon,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158135,"A distributed database management system (DDBMS) offers an organization the ability to centralize or decentralize its management of data. In this paper we examine how the likelihood of DDBMS adoption is affected by four organizational factors, drawn from previous research and a pilot study conducted by the authors: (1) centralization - decentralization of management decision making; (2) centralization - decentralization of the information systems function; (3) attitudes of top management toward technology; and (4) forces behind information technology selection. We surveyed the chief information officers of 500 companies selected from the top Fortune industrials and the top Fortune service firms. Our results demonstrate that the decentralization of decision making, the decentralization of the information systems structure, and the attitudes of top management toward technology explain the propensity to adopt DDBMS; the locus of responsibility for driving the selection of information technology does not significantly explain DDBMS adoption in the way we hypothesized. Understanding an organization in terms of these factors is important in assessing the organization's readiness to adopt DDBMS technology and ability to use DDBMS successfully upon adoption."
The role of a natural language interface in diffusing computer assisted journalism: an empirical investigation,Linda Roberge,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158138,"Based on innovation diffusion theory, an individual's decision to adopt an innovation is related to how the individual in question perceives the innovation. Of concern to this study is whether or not a natural language interface can modify how the characteristics of a technological innovation are perceived. This issue will be examined by exploring the impact of a natural language interface on individual perceptions of computer assisted journalism."
Adoption of OIS by four groups of office workers: an analysis from the perspective of innovation diffusion theory,Jaak Jurison,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158226,"This paper analyzes the adoption of six different applications of an integrated office information system (OIS) by four categories of office workers: managers, project engineers, professionals, and secretaries over a three-year time period. The data show a substantial variance across time, workgroups, and applications, in terms of adoption rates and perceptions of technology. The results suggest a model for predicting technology adoption in the long run, based on initial adoption rates and perceptions of technology."
Effectively utilizing systems developers on projects,A. Nelson,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158227,"Today's systems developer should possess skills to deal with a range of social and technical issues during systems development. However, all developers do not excel in every skill dimension. Some may possess very good people skills but only average technical skills, while others may possess very good technical and functional skills but only average people and political skills. Furthermore, all IS projects are not the same. They may differ on dimensions such as size, number of users, user comprehension of tasks, degree of integration, and degree of change. Therefore, the mix of skills needed for successfully completing each project may be different depending upon the nature of the project."
Developing efficient relationships with I/S vendors: a contingency framework,Robert Klepper,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158228,"This paper proposes a contingency framework for answering the questions: What is the range of options available in outsourcing relationships? And, how can the best, most appropriate relationship be identified? Answers to these questions are important because of the considerable resources that will be devoted to outsourcing in the future. A case study analysis is proposed for a test of the framework."
A contingency model for mapping chargeback systems to information system environments,Malini Sridhar,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158229,
Changing roles of information systems professionals: from technical managers to strategic leaders,Karin Klenke,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158230,"In this paper it is argued that existing and emergent technologies provide leadership opportunities for information systems (IS) professionals that allow them to expand their roles from technical managers to strategic leaders. Four particular leadership roles are proposed which IS professionals are positioned to occupy and specific technologies supporting these leadership roles including group decision support systems, executive informations systems, and strategic information systems are discussed. A conceptual model, the leadership-technology cube, is presented which links leadership skills and leadership roles to information technologies which jointly affect leadership outcomes. In order for IS professionals to assume the leadership roles proposed here, they must develop new competencies beyond technical expertise, especially interpersonal and conceptual skills and rethink the IS career concept."
Industry influence on IS personnel and roles,Fred Neiderman,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158231,"In recent years, IS departments within non-IS product firms have been challenged by growing number of firms turning to outsourcing and packaged software for new applications development. These trends, along with general downsizing of IS operations, have led to distinguishing between IS personnel working in different industries. This paper proposes considering two dimensions along which industry differences may influence the role of IS professionals and presents a model for examining how these industry differences working through differences in IS department structure and IS personnel characteristics influence productivity. Research propositions and their rationale are presented along with a proposed approach toward investigating these questions."
The impact of total quality management on the roles and responsibilities of information systems professionals,Mary Sumner,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158232,
Designing information systems for changing organizations,Hannu Salmela,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158233,"Information systems are nowadays developed and implemented in organizations flavored by changes in their environment and work practices. For information systems (IS) developers this is reflected in terms of changes in the information needs of users during the development phase, increased requests for adaptive maintenance and sometimes in abandonment of a systems as âuseless for the current situationâ. These issues are often not considered to be the responsibility of IS developers, or simply seen as unfortunate facts of life. This paper takes a different view. If the analyst is able to provoke discussion concerning changes in the user organization, s/he may not only be able to avoid the aforementioned difficulties, but may also be able to bring added value to the organization by supporting desired changes through IS design. This type of thinking has already been adopted in many of the methods used in strategic IS planning. The method presented in this paper is meant to be used in the process of analyzing user requirements in an individual IS project. It also provides rough guidelines for choosing between alternative design options during systems development. The method is illustrated in use by descriptions of three action research projects. In each project the role of IS in relation to changes in the user organization was analyzed, and advice was given on the client's specific IS problems. The advice was both understood and accepted by decision makers in each client organization."
Implementing empowerment through teams: the case of Texaco's information technology division,Rudy Hirschheim,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158234,"From near-bankruptcy in 1987, Texaco Inc.âone of the largest companies in the worldâhas experienced a rapid return to profitability. Texaco's turnaround is attributed at least in part to Total Quality Management and a dramatic change in corporate culture that has led to empowerment of the workforce. This case study focuses on empowerment, describes the change that has taken place over the last five years and in particular examines the Information Technology (IT) Division. Within this division 131 ânatural work groupsâ form the core of a team approach that embodies new responsibilities, authorities and team processes. People and quality have been emphasized and a process of continuous improvement has commenced. These changes reflect significant empowerment of the workforce. As a result there is tangible evidence of success both in regard to the efficiency and effectiveness of IT services. IT personnel feel good about the quality of their output and user satisfaction is high. Texaco's IT Division has been cited both internally and externally for its exemplary and world-class performance in quality through team empowerment. The case concludes with lessons that other corporations might learn from the Texaco experience."
Information systems and power: structural versus personal views,Rebecca Koop,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158235,"Power issues impact information systems design, development, and implementation. Our understanding of the sources of power affects how we interpret its potential impacts. This study examines the foundations of both personal and structural power sources. The outcomes of two well-known IS case studies are re-interpreted using the two perspectives. This study shows that IS researchers should employ a structural view of power when exploring its impact on IS design and implementation."

Information systems internships: the student perspective,Karen Ketler,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158237,"This article reports the results of a survey of 21 internships in information systems. Results showed that there was a wide variety of activities used in the internship. However, older technologies, such as COBOL, were mentioned more often than the newer technologies, such as CASE and SQL. The internships were rated based on the five core job characteristics as defined by Hackmana nd Oldham. As expected, skill variety was the lowest rated. Students indicated that they did NOT desire to learn a variety of new tools in the internship, but were contented to utilize what they already knew. The other four job characteristics, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback were present in the internships. Additional results about the students' confidence and reasons for accepting the internship are also reported."
A SQL project as a learning method in a database course,Behrooz Seyed-Abbassi,"June 1993,",https://doi.org/10.1145/158011.158238,This paper presents a learning method which is being used at the University of North Florida in the database processing class for Information Systems (IS) students. The method incorporates a major project utilizing Structured Query Language (SQL). This project enhances the students understanding of the theoretical concepts of relational database by providing a simulation of a business environment-like experience. The hands-on practice with SQL and the development of a database which considers the application of referential integrity increases the students awareness of the complex computer technology requirements within a business organization. This awareness and knowledge prepares the IS students for successful employment as IS personnel within the business community.
